00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:39.320
Your Majesty,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.000
the Prince Regent said

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.320
you haven't visited Her Grace for days.

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.719
To ensure the continuity
of the imperial bloodline,

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:49.184
these coming days,

00:00:49.184 --> 00:00:52.439
you should spend time with Her Grace.

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:53.920
If I refuse,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.920
would you dare kill me?

00:00:56.864 --> 00:00:57.439
Your Majesty.

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:58.880
Spare me, Your Majesty.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.479
I would never dare commit regicide!

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.680
Your Grace.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.519
Your Majesty,

00:01:38.592 --> 00:01:41.280
try this pastry. It was
your childhood favorite.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.040
I'm not hungry.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:43.760
Stop fussing over me.

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:54.799
You excel at painting.

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.000
Please instruct me.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.079
Take a look.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.519
It's good.

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:06.680
You rarely visit my palace willingly.

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:08.719
Why ignore me now?

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:10.560
You know clearly

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:13.000
whether I came willingly, don't you?

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.240
Your Majesty,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.800
it's late.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.280
Allow me to attend to your rest.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.159
Gao Zhiying,

00:02:29.632 --> 00:02:30.759
nothing actually happened

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.088
between us that night.

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.240
Is that truly so?

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.960
I only see you as my sister.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.639
How could anything occur between us?

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.919
Look at me.

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:55.240
Look at me and say it.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.352
Have you never fallen for me?

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.159
You know well

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.360
why Gao Ji forced me

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.639
to marry you.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.120
You're lying!

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.144
Then why do you

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.800
come here tonight?

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.000
They've captured Cheng Ge.

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:19.599
Cheng Ge.

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.120
Cheng Ge. Always Cheng Ge.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.479
Am I, legitimate daughter
of the Gao family,

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.280
inferior to a waiting maid?

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.400
Look around you.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.960
At the imperial court,

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:31.719
is there sincerity?

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:35.919
I simply wish

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.504
to share mutual honesty,

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.039
brew wine and tea,

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.400
and live a peaceful life
with my beloved.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.039
I can give you

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.400
the life you want.

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:46.680
My brother promised

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.400
that if I bear the royal heir,

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:50.159
he'll let us live a carefree life

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.520
in seclusion.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.800
Do you believe that?

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:57.599
He promised me that.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.240
But if the price

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.360
is making your child with your beloved

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.719
become another political puppet,

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:07.560
would you still agree?

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:18.759
You want to save Cheng Ge,

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:20.519
don't you?

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.199
To save her,

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:24.639
I'll do anything.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.208
Fine.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.920
I

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.600
want you

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.439
to share my bed

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.120
tonight.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.439
What charm does Cheng Ge possess

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.319
that makes you sacrifice like this?

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:42.240
I understand your feelings now.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.920
I'll keep my promise.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.759
Leave.

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:48.840
I promised His Majesty this.

00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:51.399
I'm not here for you.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.440
Wait.

00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:08.879
The antidote for His Majesty's
Frost Poison

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:10.919
is in the box on the desk

00:09:11.399 --> 00:09:12.639
in my brother's chamber.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.559
Your Majesty,

00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:06.200
Her Grace went to release Cheng Ge.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:09.639
Your Majesty,

00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:11.080
your Frost Poison flares.

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:12.240
Let's return to rest.

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:12.799
No!

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.464
I must save Cheng Ge.

00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:17.759
Your Majesty. Your health comes first.
