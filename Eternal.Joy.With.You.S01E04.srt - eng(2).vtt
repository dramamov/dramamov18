=Eternal Joy With You=
=Episode 4=

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.880
It's you.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.760
It's really you.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.280
You help scum favor his mistress
over his wife.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.880
You drove me to hang myself.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.110
It is you.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.030
Give me back my life.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.110
Stay away, stay away.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.270
Who are you?

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.040
I am the Madam of the Wang Family.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.950
You caused my family to be ruined
and destroyed.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.590
I will take your life.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.040
No, don't come closer.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.510
Master.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.150
It's you.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.990
Ah?

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.590
You bullied me because my husband died,

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.310
cheated me out of my family fortune,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.870
ruined my reputation,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.870
and destroyed my family.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.680
I will kill you.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.200
You are Ms. Li from the East City.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.350
How could it...

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.870
I was wrong.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.790
Master,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.150
what are you doing?

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.520
Well,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.040
what's going on here?

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.240
You...

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.750
Who exactly are you?

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.710
I don't know what's going on.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.030
Someone has been asking me

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.310
to pass a message to you.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.680
What?

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.640
Master,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.280
I'll give you another chance.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.710
Take a good look

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.840
at who is possessed by evil spirits.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.360
If you make a mistake again,

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.470
I will gouge out your eyes

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.680
and take your life.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.590
I was wrong.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.080
I failed to recognize the facts.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.000
I found the wrong person.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.750
Those evil spirits...

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:42.590
It's her.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.520
I recognized her.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.870
She is the worst evil spirit

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.840
who has disturbed the peace
of this residence.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.840
Are you crazy?

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.990
Xu Wannning,

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.800
what exactly did you do to him?

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.950
I...

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.800
Master, please take a good look.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.900
How could the evil spirits
possibly be on Qingqing?

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.080
Isn't it on her?

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.800
Master,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.630
you just said if a person is possessed
by evil spirits,

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.120
how should we drive out them?

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.120
The first lash drives away misfortune.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.800
The second lash banishes ghosts.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.360
The third lash expels demons.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.640
Master,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.240
are three whips enough?

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.430
Everyone in this residence

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.030
must whip her.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.240
Otherwise, the evil spirits
can't be exorcised

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.190
and will harm everyone.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.310
I remember Qingqing also said
that it must be whipped.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.280
Then let's begin.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.080
Don't come over. It's not me.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.430
Marquis, please help me quickly!

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.270
Master.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.630
Qingqing,

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.240
Yunfeng specially invited the Master
to drive out evil spirits,

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.710
just to help Ping's illness
recover faster

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.630
and get rid of the scar on your face.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.750
Qingqing, just bear with it.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.360
This is all for the Cui Family.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.280
The three lashes will be done quickly.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.030
Master.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.750
Stop!

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.240
There is no evil spirit.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.590
It's all fake.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.510
It's all fake?

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.360
Could it be

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.630
that it was all arranged by you?

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.310
How could that be possible?

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.040
Master, I remember you said before

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.120
we also have to whip her.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.560
Right, Yunfeng?

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.640
Qingqing.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:44.600
Stop that! Stop!

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.440
Alright.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.300
All evil spirits were eliminated.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.310
Three lashes are enough.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.750
Exactly.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.000
There are no more evil spirits.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.630
No evil spirits anymore?

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.750
That's wonderful.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.270
Qingqing, you have suffered.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.310
All of this is for our own good.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.870
It is all for the good
of the Cui Family.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.430
By the way, there is good news.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.040
A Master Physician has taken the notice.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.600
Your face will recover soon.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.440
Very good.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:23.870
I am but a humble person,

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.240
indeed the Master Physician

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.310
whom you spoke of.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.600
(I clearly have arranged someone.)

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.870
(How could it be him?)

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:41.920
We meet again.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.600
I want to give you a gift.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:54.840
Hurry up, go.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.240
Cui... Lord Cui,

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.600
you... you must save me.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.120
It was you who arranged for me to act.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.480
You... you have to speak up for me.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.640
Stop making false accusations.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.920
Your skills in Taoist methods
are lacking,

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.600
bluffing and bringing trouble
upon yourself.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:08.710
Take him away quickly.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.340
Marquis Cui!

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.000
Marquis Cui!

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.120
Madam, Lord,

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.190
you must stand up for me.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.430
That woman is deep-minded

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.510
and deliberately scheming,

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.510
causing me to become a laughingstock
in front of everyone.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.600
It doesn't matter if I embarrass myself.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
But everything I did

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.630
was for Ping.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.950
Qingqing,

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.360
what did you do for Ping?

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.680
Mother,

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.240
this is the Master Physician I found.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.920
He can treat Ping

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.480
and also Qingqing's illness.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.470
Really?

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.000
Quickly bring Ping over
for the physician to examine.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.920
Yes.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.000
Master Physician?

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.870
Why don't you check it for me first?

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.480
I am unable to
cure this young lady's illness.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.040
You can't?

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.390
Isn't this fraud?

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:18.790
Madam Cui,

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.270
is this the Master Physician you invited
at a high price?

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.110
Miss,

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.950
to cure illness,
one must first cure the heart.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.390
Only when you heal your own heart

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.190
will there be a chance for your illness
to get better.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:33.920
What does this mean?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.310
It means

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.190
your heart is not clean.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.270
Once your heart becomes clean,

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.480
the face will naturally get better.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.160
Young Master Ping has arrived.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.230
Ping.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.600
Come quickly.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.360
Young Master Ping's illness
can be cured.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.390
It's just that

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.040
I need a guiding herb.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:15.450
Hongmei,

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.750
take Ping away to rest first.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.760
Yes.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:19.460
Ping, come on.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.390
Master Physician,

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.800
just let me know what guiding herb
is needed.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.480
Hongzhen Incense.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.720
Hongzhen Incense
is a prohibited medicine.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.910
How could our family possibly have it?

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:46.480
If that is the case,

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.360
Young Master Ping's illness,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.030
I'm afraid...

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.870
Master Physician,

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.390
we are unable to obtain it.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.790
But please try to think of a way.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.360
No matter how much money it costs,

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:01.790
we are willing.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:03.630
Mother,

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.360
I will take the Master Physician
to rest for a while.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.550
Let him think carefully

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:09.030
and see if there is any other method.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.040
Please.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.320
Master Physician, please.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.270
Commander Pei, you changed your identity
to enter the Mansion.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.840
It was for Hongzhen Incense, wasn't it?

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.320
Cui Qingping is your son?

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.440
What do you mean?

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.670
If he really is your son,

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.840
his illness should have been cured
long ago.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.150
The deadly disease known
as Corpse Blossom Rash

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.190
is difficult for anyone to cure.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.870
How could a woman like me
have such great ability?

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.200
I am just curious

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.390
if you can really cure Ping's illness.

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:56.960
If it cannot be cured,

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.840
what will you do then?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.390
Since I have taken down your notice,

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.270
I naturally have a countermeasure.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.030
Then I shall watch closely

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.080
how

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.630
you will respond.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.510
Lady Xu, rest assured.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.440
You just do whatever you wish to do.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.000
Leave the rest to me.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.520
I will definitely not stand in your way

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.030
and ruin your plans.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.120
Hongzhen Incense?

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:55.990
You placed it.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:57.670
What do you think?

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.870
If it wasn't you,

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.840
then there must be someone else
in the Mansion.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.600
It seems the fish has already
taken the bait.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.080
I just found the right spot

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.150
and put down the bait.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.600
If I want to know the truth,

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.080
I still need to cast a long line

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.720
to catch big fish.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.030
These have nothing to do with me.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.440
Since someone has already delivered it,

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.320
then Ping's illness...

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.080
Lady Xu, rest assured.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:31.390
Three days later,

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.390
Ping's face will naturally be as good
as before.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:38.550
Thank you, Commander Pei.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.860
(Marquis's Mansion in Yan City)

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.030
I am not very capable.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.790
The scar on this young lady's face

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.150
might not be removed.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.600
Madam, Lord,

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.750
you must stand up for me.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:13.550
What Master Physician?

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.510
You are nothing but a charlatan.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.670
Even Qingqing's face is like this,

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.670
wouldn't my son's face be even worse?

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:20.960
If that's the case,

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:23.630
I'll kill you first.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.550
You're just a physician.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.000
How could you have so much strength?

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.360
Who exactly are you?

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:33.910
I travel around the world

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.600
and always encounter some ruffians.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.910
I need some basic martial skills
for protection.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.160
Yunfeng,

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.550
the gauze on Ping's face has not yet
been removed.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.200
Everything is still unknown.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.670
If Ping's face is perfectly fine now,

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.080
wouldn't you have wronged Physician Pei?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:13.840
Ping,

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.000
come here and let me see.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.720
Yunfeng, you should apologize.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:28.390
Apologize?

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.120
To whom?

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.480
Of course, to Physician Pei.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.120
If your impulsive actions today

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:38.630
were to spread outside,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.470
it may damage the reputation
of the Cui Family.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.360
My son's face is fine,

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.080
but Qingqing still has scars
on her face.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.840
I remember Physician Pei has long said,

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.910
due to an unclean heart,

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.030
her illness has not yet healed.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:57.960
Now, her current situation

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.080
is the consequence of her own actions.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:02.710
Apologize.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.840
Alright.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.840
Show mercy where mercy is due.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.670
Who exactly is your husband?

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.840
Do you still have any shame?

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.030
Physician Pei has the benevolent heart.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.630
He naturally would not be angry.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.670
Although the scars on Ping's face
have healed,

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:24.870
the illness has not yet been cured.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.700
It still requires time for recuperation.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:33.430
Alright.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.270
Please stay in the residence
for a few more days.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.030
First, help my grandson fully recover.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.720
Second, give Qingqing a proper check-up.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.100
I entrust this to you, Physician Pei.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.560
Feng,

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:50.510
apologize quickly.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:03.840
It was rude of me.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.840
Please forgive me, Physician Pei.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:12.000
No problem.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.080
My Lady,

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.440
there is news about the midwife
who delivered you back then.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:39.710
Quick, tell me.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.320
She has always lived in a village
on the west side of the city.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.080
She has still been making a living
by delivering babies.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:46.750
But she acts very secretively.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.550
I don't know what she's afraid of.

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.670
(I'll go find her right now
and get to the bottom of it.)

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.320
My Lord.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.200
What is it?

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:03.350
She went out.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:05.470
Got it.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:06.350
You may step back.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:07.230
Yes.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.240
This woman has been going out
frequently lately.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.000
I wonder if she's secretly meeting
some man again.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.510
I had someone keep an eye on her

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.750
to catch her making a mistake.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.670
Once I catch her,

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.510
I'll take the opportunity
to divorce her.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.840
I'll go see right now

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.150
what this woman is up to.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:35.470
