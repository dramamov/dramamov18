[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.940
[Episode 13]

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.200
Foxy Tang,

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:34.840
we've finally found you.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.350
How are you?

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.410
You look terrible.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.610
The battle just ended.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.520
I am a bit tired.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.350
How are Shei and the Wanqiao Chamber

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.920
doing?

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.229
Who would dare to mess with
the Wanqiao Chamber?

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.360
You should rest now.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.039
Shen and I will keep watch.

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.600
Don't worry about anything else.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.080
Chi Yun.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:50.479
Shen.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.680
An hour.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.180
I only need an hour.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.039
Okay.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.050
What's happening?

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.540
The former top-ranked assassin,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.190
Meihua Yishu.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.750
Why would someone
who disappeared 800 years ago

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.280
come here to cause trouble?

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.280
Tang Lici,

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.750
I'm here.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.770
You're good at running away.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.660
Master doesn't want you
to die too quickly.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.280
But I

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.850
don't have that much patience.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.770
I'll go beat her up.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.150
Let me.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.690
You'll be at a disadvantage if you go.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.230
Watch him.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.480
Kill.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.170
It's a human puppet.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.040
When attacking,

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.440
it can't transform.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.880
Assassins

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.750
are good at seizing opportunities.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.320
A human puppet's power

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.310
is only half that of the original person.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.330
You shouldn't have made him
a human puppet.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.230
What's wrong with being a human puppet?

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.430
A forever beautiful and powerful body.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.360
It won't age.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.070
It won't get sick.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:50.680
It won't be damaged.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.920
Shen Langhun,

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:53.690
Yu Qifeng is dead.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.360
The deal is done.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.159
Is Tang Lici

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.180
worth the risk?

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.310
I get paid to do my job.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.270
I like

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.040
a man who can lie.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.890
Are you okay,

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:22.360
Shen?

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.990
There's more than one of them.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.680
Kuanglan Wuxing,

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.920
one of the 7 masters

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.460
in the battle of Tiandu Peak,

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.320
is now the Fengliu Shop's lackey.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.720
Before the master,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.190
Chi Yun,

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.610
how can you protect Tang Lici?

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.120
A human puppet

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.159
is no match for a living person!

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:22.470
Today,

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:23.920
with me here,

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.160
you won't get past.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.480
Such touching friendship.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.430
It's unfortunate

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:33.750
that you waste the rest of your lives

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.120
for the sake of Tang Lici,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.480
the hypocrite.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.440
I wonder when you're in the underworld,

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.920
will you

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.740
regret it?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.630
Shen!

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:22.800
Foxy Tang.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:28.480
How are you feeling?

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:30.500
It's fine.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.669
Are you okay, Foxy Tang?

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:35.760
Don't worry.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:36.909
I'm fine.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.419
An hour has passed.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.510
Now,

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.080
leave it to me.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:45.360
Chi Yun.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.800
You go ahead.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.200
Meet me at the usual place.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.200
Cut the nonsense.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.040
I'm your bodyguard.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.630
If you die,

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.260
where does that leave my reputation?

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:04.730
Don't be reckless.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:05.810
Don't worry.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:07.650
I'm not that easy to kill.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.260
Master once said

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.830
Mr. Tang is good at winning people over,

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.670
but for a dead man,

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.630
winning over countless hearts

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.390
is of no use at all.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.180
They are my people.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.910
Of course, I'll protect them.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.030
How fake you are.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.590
Back in Sword King City,

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.720
you relied on the flower sea's advantage,

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.380
yet still couldn't defeat me.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.690
Now with these 2 human puppets,

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.790
you dare to challenge me?

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.190
Then stay here forever.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:53.260
Big talk.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.720
Miss, you've chosen a good melody.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:13.930
Such praise

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:15.370
pleases me.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:16.600
I bet

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:17.870
Liu Yan knows nothing

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.130
about this operation,

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.410
or he would have warned you

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.720
that Tang Lici

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.800
is unmatched under heaven,

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:26.090
and don't perform

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.080
such poor tricks before him.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.530
I might as well tell you, Miss,

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:33.910
that this melody

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.960
was composed by me.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:33.730
Good.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:34.960
Come. Come.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.960
Put it here first.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:38.600
Is it enough?

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.840
Gu Xitan,

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.250
where have you been?

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.200
Zhong.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:44.600
What happened?

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.240
Master has already

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.790
issued a jianghu arrest warrant

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:48.200
to hunt down Mr. Tang at all costs.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.440
How could this happen?

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.840
There's no evidence yet.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.150
It involves Yique Yinyang.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:53.950
Hard to go against public anger.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:55.790
But Master had no choice.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:57.410
We need to find Mr. Tang

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:58.880
and help him escape.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.240
Help him escape?

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.030
But this will violate
Sword Alliance rules.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.120
If Master Shao finds out,

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.320
he'll surely blame us.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.030
But you also know

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:08.240
Mr. Tang is innocent.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:09.240
If even we

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.440
don't trust Mr. Tang,

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:11.320
then he'll truly be

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.200
left all alone.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.250
Alright, I'll go with you.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:16.270
But Miss Shei

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.680
is still at Wanqiao Chamber.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.840
I'm afraid the people from Sword King City

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.550
will give her a hard time.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.010
We need to take her with us.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.330
That makes sense.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:22.870
Go.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:23.630
Go.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.690
Liu Yan used this melody before

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.800
to kill me once.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:55.400
If he comes,

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.930
I will likewise use this melody

00:14:59.120 --> 00:14:59.790
to kill him.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:02.600
Is that so?

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.150
Well, I think

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.510
your situation

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:09.440
isn't necessarily

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.960
much better than mine.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.150
I can kill you right now.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.000
But I won't do that.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.630
Because I want to see,

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.260
if I take you captive,

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.790
whether Liu Yan will appear

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.030
to save you.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:49.440
No.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.940
You'd better just kill me.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.550
Mr. Tang, you were indeed right.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.240
This hairpin

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:44.630
is sharper.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.840
It's easier to stab into the abdomen.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:01.880
Do I look beautiful?

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:03.460
You...

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.510
I am Xifang Tao,

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:12.270
Palace Chief of the West Palace
of the Fengliu Shop.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.359
I met you once before.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.240
You've come at the right time.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:18.680
Hurry

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:20.680
and kill Tang Lici now.

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:24.700
Master wishes to see Mr. Tang.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:27.240
Please come with me.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.970
Please follow me, Mr. Tang.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:58.690
Who is he?

00:17:59.240 --> 00:17:59.900
After them.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.300
Hurry, after them!

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.660
Did you see that sword?

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.070
That's one of
the Heaven-Earth-Human Swords,

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:07.000
the Earth Sword.

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:08.920
The person is Cheng Yunpao,

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.240
who ranked second
in the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.240
His power

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.480
far surpasses that of Yu Qifeng.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.640
Look at yourself.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:40.160
Get up.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:49.000
Xiaohong,

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.510
you shouldn't be so nice

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.000
to men all the time.

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:54.330
Sometimes, you need to understand

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:55.590
what men are thinking.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.190
If you prevent Master
from taking revenge himself,

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:00.590
how much must he hate you?

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:06.790
I don't want

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:09.110
Master

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.290
to hold only hatred.

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:17.310
Why don't you find another man then?

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.940
Don't joke with me.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.350
I'm saying this

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.270
seriously.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.190
There are signs of fighting here.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:15.680
Gu,

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:16.980
what is it?

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:24.930
Someone was definitely here,

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.560
but they must have just left.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.720
What did you find?

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:35.960
Sword marks.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.390
This is my senior's Earth Sword.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:39.830
Your senior?

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:40.590
Yes,

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:41.880
my senior,

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:43.310
Cheng Yunpao.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:46.110
This year is the once-in-a-decade time

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:48.110
when Camellia Island comes ashore.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.000
Has Master Cheng come ashore?

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:53.870
What's wrong?

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.200
I'm afraid...

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:58.360
My senior hates evil with a passion.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.000
Besides,

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.000
Camellia Island imprisons

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.300
all the remnants of the Jile Sect.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.480
The news of Mr. Tang's arrest warrant

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.610
has already spread.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.570
If he runs into Mr. Tang,

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.330
it'll be terrible.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.210
The situation is really not good.

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:35.950
I'll ask you 3 questions.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.690
You'd better answer truthfully.

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:43.160
I

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.580
don't like being threatened.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.570
First question.

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:48.520
Was Fang Zhou

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:50.790
killed by you?

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:53.880
Yes.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.400
You're very brave.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.160
Well, I'm Tang Lici after all.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.160
Second question.

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:14.210
What is your relationship

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.770
with Yique Yinyang?

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.400
No relationship.

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:19.680
Third question.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:21.960
Your background.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:30.620
Master Cheng,

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.260
if you keep asking,

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:33.400
I'm afraid

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:35.680
I won't be able to answer.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:37.570
You know who I am?

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.010
Dressed in blue robes.

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:41.810
Cold as frost.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:44.970
With twin swords at your side.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.060
Your technique

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:49.950
is the Heaven-Earth-Human Swords Mantra.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.240
You are the Island's Grand Judge

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.030
personally appointed

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.260
by Camellia Island Master Wei Beiyin

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:56.910
and his senior disciple,

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.090
Shuangjian Qihan,

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:00.720
Cheng Yunpao.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:02.270
Very well.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.140
Since you know my name,

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:07.630
you should know my personality.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.170
Camellia Island

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:11.110
holds many followers

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:12.510
of Yique Yinyang.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:15.790
They're all
under Master Cheng's supervision.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:16.510
I've heard

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:19.160
Master Cheng despises evil.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.830
There's a saying in the jianghu,

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:23.830
"Better to take a palm strike from Puzhu

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:25.790
than face the twin swords of Camellia."

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.030
Puzhu has mercy,

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:29.070
but I don't.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:30.950
I have another identity—

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.100
a good friend of Head Fang.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.940
If that's the case,

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.640
Master Cheng should know

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:44.440
when I met Fang Zhou,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.600
I had already lost my memory.

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:51.430
I couldn't remember my past.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.460
Fang Zhou once wrote to me,

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:55.830
saying he had taken in someone

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:57.890
with golden eyes and a forehead mark.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.880
I wrote back saying,

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.110
if it were me,

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.800
I would never keep you alive.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.230
For anyone connected to Yique Yinyang,

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:12.030
it's better to wrongly condemn them

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:13.230
than let them escape.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.350
Fang Zhou once warned me

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.650
never to reveal
my golden eyes and forehead mark.

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:25.110
You should have listened to him.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:29.510
So,

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:31.510
Fang Zhou was right.

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:33.150
People

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.540
only see
the golden eyes and forehead mark.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.080
Even the universally acknowledged,

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:46.310
most upright
and incorruptible Grand Judge,

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:47.110
Cheng Yunpao,

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.620
only recognizes
the golden eyes and forehead mark.

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:54.310
How ridiculous that Camellia Island

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:56.970
claims to execute judgment
on heaven's behalf.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:59.300
But did heaven tell you,

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.160
regardless of right or wrong,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.800
or what they've done in the past,

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.410
as long as they're suspicious,

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.730
they should all be killed with one strike?

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:12.110
Is that right?

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.240
Master Cheng,

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.480
I also want to ask you a question.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.350
Have you ever killed someone by mistake

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:30.200
with your sword?

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:15.650
Chi Yun.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.310
Shen Langhun.

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:22.960
Second Island Master of Camellia Island,

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.370
Shuangjian Qihan,

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:25.830
Cheng Yunpao.

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:30.680
Come at me together.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.710
Senior! Shen!

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.040
Chi! Stop!

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:44.550
Mr. Tang.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:45.980
Mr. Tang.

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:47.340
Mr. Tang.

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:48.990
Mr. Tang.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.960
Senior.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:54.840
They...

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.650
Move aside.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:08.110
Chi.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.080
How are Mr. Tang's injuries?

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:26.190
His wounds are too severe.

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:27.190
He can't be saved.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.790
That's impossible.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:37.270
Senior,

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.030
is there no other way?

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.200
Mr. Tang.

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.040
Impossible.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:49.590
Foxy Tang can't die.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.280
He has medicines.

00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:59.750
Premium life-extending pills.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:01.510
And this Borrowing Life from Heaven pill.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:02.680
With so many famous medicines,

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.340
Foxy Tang can surely be saved.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.240
These medicines are rare treasures
that appear once in 100 years,

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.880
or even once in 1,000 years.

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.780
His life force is already exhausted.

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:10.740
Using them on him

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:12.280
would be a waste.

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:17.750
No way.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:18.920
Shen,

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.860
go get some water.

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.200
These medicines must be given to him,
even if we have to force them down.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:22.830
Foxy Tang.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.010
I'm your bodyguard.

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:27.110
If you die,

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:29.110
where will I put my face?

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.880
Tang Lici.

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:31.720
Do me this favor.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.030
Wake up.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:35.760
Foxy Tang.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:37.800
Foxy Tang.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.740
What are you doing?

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:03.710
I can save him.

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:52.000
Well done, Lici.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.260
You're making fast progress.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:57.270
Teaching him to play the flute
is one thing,

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:58.790
and you're teaching him to play the qin
as well.

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:00.750
Aren't you afraid
a master will lose his edge

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.880
by teaching a disciple all his skills?

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.350
Where did this letter come from?

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:06.610
From Camellia Island.

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:09.950
But it's really strange.

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:11.000
This month,

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.680
the Central Plains Sword Alliance
and Camellia Island

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.740
both sent letters.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.640
Why?

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:17.350
They say
a strange meteorite fell not long ago.

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.010
Rumors have it that it's a sign

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:21.510
that Yique Yinyang
will return to this world.

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:22.550
Why so tense?

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:24.390
Is it that necessary?

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.070
Yes, yes.

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:28.680
It concerns Yique Yinyang.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.880
We must be cautious.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.670
By the way,

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:39.960
this is the reply to Camellia Island.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.310
I've finished writing it.

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:43.590
Take it to the town post station
immediately

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:45.640
and deliver it
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.200
I'll go.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:49.720
Lici,

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:51.830
you'd better let Yan go instead.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.030
Why not let him go?

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.640
Enough.

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.970
Fine, fine.

00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.070
Practice your qin well.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:10.760
Fang Zhou.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.550
Do you

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:14.910
fear me?

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:17.350
Why do you ask?

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.710
Is it because of
the golden eyes and forehead mark?

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:23.790
Actually, when I

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:24.590
first saw you,

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:25.680
I already knew.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.410
However,

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:29.180
this doesn't mean

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:30.770
you are Yique Yinyang.

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:33.690
But even though you don't fear me,

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.110
others will.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.160
With the remnants
of the Jile Sect appearing,

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:38.960
the jianghu

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:40.790
is in panic,

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.770
and everyone is terrified.

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:44.000
If others know

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:47.270
I also have
golden eyes and a forehead mark,

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:47.830
then Zhoudi Tower...

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:49.160
Even if people find out,

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.680
I'll act

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.880
as the Chief of Zhoudi Tower

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.680
and tell them:

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:54.480
Is Yique Yinyang

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.550
born inherently evil?

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.720
If the golden eyes and forehead mark

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.960
were also on my face,

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:03.930
would I be unforgivably evil too?

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:05.240
Lici,

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:06.570
these things

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:08.870
don't determine who you are.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:11.370
Now that you've joined Zhoudi Tower,

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.960
you are Tang Lici.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:16.890
Yique Yinyang.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.360
You fear Yique Yinyang.

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:26.370
Do you fear me too?

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.850
Then, will all these years of feelings

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:36.240
just disappear?

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.550
[Clear Rivers, Calm Seas,
and a Peaceful World]

00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.310
Disappear.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:00.540
Disappear.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:10.920
Leave.

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:13.470
I want to leave.

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:37.770
My wounds have healed.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.490
Give me an explanation.

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:41.270
I...

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:44.670
Last time at the flower sea was you.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:45.590
And this time,

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.260
it's you again.

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.830
Shei.

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:51.240
I like secrets.

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:53.240
But right now,

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.870
that won't do.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:55.920
Tell me,

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:57.750
who are you really?

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.969
Your blood can heal wounds,

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:13.239
which makes you a living miracle cure.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.400
A weak and helpless

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.060
orphan girl

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.590
with such an ability

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:20.190
can survive unharmed

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.000
until now.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.440
My blood can heal you.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.360
I tested it.

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:34.340
This is my only secret.

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:37.960
It sounds

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:39.590
almost like some kind of

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:40.790
divine arrangement.

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:43.460
I know that right now,

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.280
you won't believe anything I say.

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:48.590
That's why I never

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:49.719
planned to tell you.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:51.840
But please at least believe

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.280
that I'll never harm you,

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:56.280
alright?

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:31.310
You should go.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.030
Now,

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:38.530
keeping you here serves no purpose.

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.400
I don't need you to follow me either.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:52.630
Shei's blood

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:54.230
can actually save Mr. Tang.

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:57.290
But I've never heard her reveal this
before.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:58.770
Though it makes sense.

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.720
Since her blood is so miraculous,

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:01.870
if word got out,

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:03.630
wouldn't everyone in the world

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:04.230
covet it?

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:06.950
Shen.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:09.150
Do you think this Cheng Yunpao

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:10.880
is just waiting for Foxy Tang to wake up

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.140
and then take him away?

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.170
That man despises evil.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.720
He won't easily let Tang Lici go.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.030
Shei.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.320
Mr. Tang...

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:28.890
He's already awake.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.100
I'll go get some water.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.250
Isn't there water near him?

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.400
Chi Yun.

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:40.910
Let's wait and see.

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:45.070
Zhong.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.960
My senior just told me

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.630
not to sit

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.190
with evil villains

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:53.590
like Shen and Chi.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:54.740
But it's fine now.

00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:58.800
Chi,

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:00.190
I didn't say this.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.480
My senior said it.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.850
Chi Yun, what are you doing?

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:05.500
Mr. Gu.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:07.800
Is your senior planning

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.000
to take Tang Lici back
to the Sword Alliance?

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:10.460
Well...

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:13.030
Isn't it obvious?

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:15.480
Years ago, the sects

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:17.110
of all Sword Masters

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:18.360
were all involved to some degree

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.290
in the conflict with the Jile Sect.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.840
This is a deep-rooted hatred.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.970
If Mr. Tang goes to the Sword Alliance,

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.010
he'll likely meet a bad end.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.070
Exactly.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:28.440
That's why we were

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.170
trying to help Mr. Tang escape.

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:32.030
Who knew my senior would show up?

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.330
Does your senior

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.140
have any weaknesses?

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:38.740
Weakness?

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:44.030
He has no sense of direction.

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:45.120
Does that count?

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.250
Can you move now?

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:56.760
Barely.

00:37:57.370 --> 00:38:00.430
Then come with me
to the Central Plains Sword Alliance.

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:02.560
Why did Master Cheng spare my life?

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:04.090
Five years ago,

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.400
Fang Zhou sent me a message,

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.530
saying he was dying.

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:09.480
He wanted to pass down
Zhoudi Tower's legacy

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.000
to you

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.260
to make you his successor.

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.710
Also,

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:15.790
he asked me to look after you.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.710
You're still alive now

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.130
because of this letter.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.670
Fang Zhou really

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:25.510
could anticipate everything.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.570
I've explained everything.

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:28.730
He's terrible with directions.

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:29.950
Perhaps what he said is true.

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:31.950
Given Camellia Island's location,

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:33.440
he should land from the northeast

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.470
of Sword King City.

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:36.400
But this place is in the southwest.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:37.530
Exactly.

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:40.510
My senior must have arranged to meet

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:42.170
Master Shao in Sword King City

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:43.570
but got lost.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.070
You mean

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:46.960
the second-ranked member
of the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.070
Cheng Yunpao,

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:50.030
has no sense of direction?

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:51.800
Don't tell anyone I said that,

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:53.240
or I'll be finished.

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:55.450
I have a solution.

00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.840
Even though I'm Fang Zhou's friend,

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.340
whether you're guilty or not

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:03.070
shouldn't be determined by me.

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:05.010
You must go to the Sword Alliance,

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:07.150
and let Master Shao investigate.

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.070
I'm afraid that
if I return to the Sword Alliance,

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:10.800
Master Shao

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:12.880
will be even less likely

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.340
to find the truth he seeks.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.510
Mr. Gu!

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:17.030
Gu Xitan!

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:18.760
Stay put.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:26.330
Where is he?

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:27.350
Master Cheng.

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:29.090
Someone just attacked so quickly.

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:30.820
I couldn't see clearly either.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.130
Running so fast.

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:36.110
Almost catching up to me.

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:48.310
It hurts.

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:49.410
Senior, I'm here!

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:52.420
Are you alright?

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:54.040
Is your injury serious?

00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:56.190
Not serious, Senior.

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:57.480
The demon from the Fengliu Shop

00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:58.280
saw you coming

00:39:58.450 --> 00:39:59.550
and knew he couldn't win,

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:00.880
so he dropped me and ran.

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:02.670
Good that you're fine.

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:04.230
Let's go. I'll take you back.

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:05.030
Wait, Senior.

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:07.350
It seems a bit serious now.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:08.800
I'm dizzy.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:12.490
Don't worry.

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:14.250
I'll bandage your wound.

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:21.330
It doesn't seem serious anymore.

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.280
It seems to be getting better.

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.270
How has it suddenly improved a bit?

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.880
Just a bit?

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:39.030
I was wrong.

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:44.190
Very good.

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:01.360
What kind of prop

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.480
did Chi make?

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.240
Tang Lici!

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:41.190
It's rare to see you

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:42.550
handle things in...

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:44.610
In such an unexpected way.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.000
It's my incompetence

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:51.310
that has turned Sword King City
into a living hell.

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:52.510
Things have gone this far,

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:53.630
yet no one has died.

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.510
It's truly remarkable.

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:57.800
The owner of the Fengliu Shop

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:58.930
who framed Tang Lici

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:01.110
is a black-clad pipa player,

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:01.960
named Liu Yan.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.070
He also came from the Zhoudi Tower

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:05.530
and is an old acquaintance

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:06.320
of Tang Lici.

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:09.230
So that means

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:11.030
the rumors about Fang Zhou's death

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:12.360
being connected to Tang Lici

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:13.440
are actually true.

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:15.210
Tang Lici admitted

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:16.740
that he killed Fang Zhou.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:18.590
Sir,

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.360
have you found Tang Lici?

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:20.960
Yes.

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:22.360
Then...

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:23.840
You let him go?

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:25.190
Yes.

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:27.370
Then he should not be a bad person.

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:29.800
To call him good,

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:32.360
he uses any means to achieve his goals;

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:33.290
to call him evil,

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.070
he also saved the people

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:36.230
of Sword King City.

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:38.320
He's not evil,

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.150
but he's not someone

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:41.570
who walks the same path as us.

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:42.900
What do you mean by that?

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.030
He said

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.800
that in matters he gets involved in,

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:48.340
it's not just heroes

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:50.460
who will be sacrificed.

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.880
That's quite an insightful statement.

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.500
I'm afraid I can't agree.

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:58.390
Sir,

00:42:58.570 --> 00:42:59.800
for the past 2 years, we've both

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:00.800
tried everything

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:01.960
to lure the Fengliu Shop into action.

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:02.920
And what did we achieve?

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:04.150
We failed completely.

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:05.110
But Tang Lici

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:06.770
took less than half a month

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:09.140
to uncover a corner of the Fengliu Shop.

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:10.810
He even drew Liu Yan out of hiding.

00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:12.590
Don't you think this stagnant situation

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:14.320
has suddenly come alive again?

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:21.440
Despite the many suspicious points
about Tang Lici,

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.440
for some reason,

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:24.050
I have this inexplicable feeling

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:25.420
in my heart

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:28.880
that this man will surely make

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.320
the chaotic jianghu

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.230
reshuffle itself.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:37.710
However,

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:40.030
your decision to let Tang Lici go
this time

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:41.230
surely isn't just because

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:42.440
of lack of evidence,

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.590
is it?

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.440
Have you and he

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.110
made some kind of agreement?

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:52.580
Biluo Palace.

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:00.550
[Sanqin]

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.550
Tang Lici is on the wanted list!

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:05.000
By order of
the Central Plains Sword Alliance,

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.400
the associates of Yique Yinyang,

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.320
Tang Lici and his accomplices,

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.980
Shen Langhun and Chi Yun,
are on the wanted list!

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.840
Wasn't Yique Yinyang already dead?

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.760
Yes, indeed.

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.020
I heard about this too.

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:16.030
It's unexpected

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:17.190
that Tang Lici and Yique Yinyang

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:18.050
are connected.

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:19.110
Aren't you concerned now?
