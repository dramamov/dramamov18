I...

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:03.380
What...

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.290
You actually caught

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.380
my spear tip using only two fingers.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.180
I have seen the Spear Deity

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.340
and his spear.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.980
Your spear

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.010
can't even compare in the slightest.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.010
Behold, my Surging Dragon Shift.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.570
If tomorrow on the battlefield you and I encounter

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.450
Ye Dingzhi,

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.890

This is as far as I can recall.

Was...

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.980
Was that the Spear Deity's Surging Dragon Shift?

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.850
The Surging Dragon Shift consists of 33 moves.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.890
I'm not skilled in spear techniques.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.010
These 13 moves

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.540
only capture the form,

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:43.820
but not the spirit.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.220
If the Spear Deity had used his spear just now,

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.570
you would have been dead

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.500

Who are you?

Anyone who knows the Spear Deity

and can perform the Surging Dragon Shift

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.940
is no ordinary martial artist.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.660
I hail not from any notable clan.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.380
I was fortunate enough

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.100
to fight alongside the Spear Deity

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.340
to stop the Demon Sect.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.940
Can I leave now?

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.500
So you were among

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.260

You may pass.

I had lost?

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:32.460
I merely know

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.730
that if I were in Xueyue City right now,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.050
I'd be gazing at snow-capped peaks,

It seems he was well prepared

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.100
and broke through.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.490

Once the initial shock wears off,

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.980

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.040
Why didn't he stop him?

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.490
Senior failed to stop him

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:21.820
and was defeated.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.010
I knew it.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.280
If anything good happens,

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.600
it never falls to us.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.050
He'd steal all the credit.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:30.130
Wuxiu.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.610
Behave.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:33.530
I

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:34.420
misspoke.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.890
What's that person's identity?

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:38.730
Unknown.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.180
He was wearing a face veil

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.180
and carrying a long sword.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.700
But when facing Senior,

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.460
he used a set of spear techniques.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:46.530
Spear techniques?

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:47.770
Which spear techniques?

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:49.580
Senior said

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:50.610
it was the Surging Dragon Shift.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:53.580
Surging Dragon Shift?

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:55.100
What?

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.530
Is he certain?

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.890
That person admitted it himself.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.220
He said he learned it after witnessing the Spear Deity Sikong Changfeng﻿

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.220
use it.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.130
I remember it.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.180
It really is the Surging Dragon Shift.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.460
Could he be sent by Xueyue City﻿?

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.850
[The Four Seekers of the Sword Arts﻿ have all set out.]
The Four Seekers of the Sword Arts﻿

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.340
have all set out.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:30.980
Good.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.940
The Four Seekers of the Sword Arts are said

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.650
to have mastered Elder Jian's true teachings.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.370
With their help,

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.610
we'll surely defeat the veiled man.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:39.420
Defeat, my foot!

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:41.890
Those four useless fools?

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:45.980
How strong can those four be?

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:47.730
That man was unbelievably strong just now.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:49.940
He's a swordsman,

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.730
but with a casual swing of my spear,

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.850
he shattered it

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:53.730
to pieces.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.700
Do you understand the mastery he possesses?

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.890
He's an expert among experts!

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:00.850
The Four Seekers of the Sword Arts﻿

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:02.650
aren't even worthy to serve beneath his feet.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:03.870
Then why

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:04.940
send them?

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:07.770
If I alone lose,

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.340
Lunwu Hall﻿ will make a big deal

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.600
to humiliate my master.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.580
If the Four Seekers of the Sword Arts﻿

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.700
suffer the same defeat,

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:16.340
it'll be their disgrace.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:18.130
And if they lose,

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.130
Elder Jian will engage that man himself.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.730
So your ultimate goal

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.730
is to force Elder Jian to stop that man.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.460
But can Elder Jian

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.420
win against him?

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.580
I sent all those people to kill you,

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:50.010
how are you still...

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.460
I had to leave to lure you into action.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.300
We've brought down the three families.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:57.650
Do you really think

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.450
you're stronger than Su Jinhui,

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:01.060
Xie Ba, and the others?

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:02.460
Weren't you

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.340
all poisoned?

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:05.980
How foolish.

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:08.460
You actually believe you could poison the Poisonous Blossom﻿.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:09.940
Your poison is useless against me.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:11.340
And my poison

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.060
can cure everyone's poison.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.490
It seems

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.460
the Mu family is seriously underestimated.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:19.820
Let me handle this, Changhe.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:21.490
Patience.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.010
Su Luandan,

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:28.650
why did you betray me?

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.220
I followed you

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.340
hoping to become head of the Su family﻿.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.580
But you handed the position to Su Muyu!

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.610
Imbecile.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.460
Who do you think you are,

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.060
to imagine yourself above Su Muyu?

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.580
You were never even part of the Su family﻿!

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:52.460
I had no intention to kill you,

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:54.820
but what you said now

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.940
compels me to end you.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.370
You were once

00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:59.490
one of the most important members of The Other Shore﻿.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:01.700
Here in The Other Shore﻿,

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:03.980
there is no distinction of family

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.180
or Nameless.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.180
Don't tell me you believe

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.730
those people joined The Other Shore﻿

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:11.960
for those

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.370
ridiculous ideals?

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:14.940
They only believe those old fools

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:16.460
have ruled

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.180
the Blood River's laws too long

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:19.770
and are seeking an opportunity

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:21.700
to overthrow them.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.490
The Other Shore﻿

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.250
just gave them that chance.

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.490
Su Luandan,

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.010
you've gone too far.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.580
You can't reach The Other Shore﻿ anymore.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.180
One last question.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.340
Who is the person

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:44.770
behind you?

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.340
How do you know?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.730
I was right about you having a backer.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.050
So be it.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.060
I won't bother guessing.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:00.990
Your death

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.300
shall be my answer to him.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.730
Should I charge through right here,

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:31.460
or...

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.770
How many checkpoints are left

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:41.850
before Wushuang City?

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:43.370
Is this your first time here?

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.770
This is the last one.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.250
Beyond this

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:48.850
is the gate of Wushuang City.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.700
I've come many times,

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.220
but this is the first time I've encountered this.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:54.650
Wushuang City.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.420
Its status declines by the day,

00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:59.980
yet its arrogance grows stronger.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.660
Are you here for business too?

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.330
Though I'm a merchant,

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.700
I deal mostly with martial artists.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:11.810
One careless step

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.700
and I'd lose my head.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.940
I'm a weapons dealer.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.290
There's a Yuexia Smithy in the city.

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:20.140
I ordered a batch of Soul-Chasing Crossbows.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:21.180
I'm here

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.010
to pick them up.

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:23.460
What a coincidence.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:24.620
So am I.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.250
We're fated to meet.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:29.090
Indeed.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.400
They're coming!

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.140
Someone's arrived!

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:32.650
Finally!

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:40.660
The Four Seekers of the Sword Arts﻿

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.420
of Lunwu Hall.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.460
Are they well-known

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.530
in Wushuang City?

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.750
Among the younger generation of Lunwu Hall﻿

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.660
in Wushuang City,

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:52.220
they are the most formidable four swordsmen.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.530
It's said

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.360
Elder Jian specially chose

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.270
four young disciples to represent

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.390
the four qualities of swordsmanship.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.070
Lightness, heaviness, swiftness, and patience.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:03.890
He intends to develop

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.570
a supreme

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.850
sword technique

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.060
by observing their growth.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:10.780
That's why these four

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:12.650
are called the Four Seekers of the Sword Arts﻿.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:14.740
So that's the story.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:16.740
I have heard

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:17.610
of Elder Jian's name.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.570
The Four Seekers of the Sword Arts

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.410
sound intriguing.

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:23.640
- They're here. - At last.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.510
They're here.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:32.670
What did

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:33.700
that troublemaker look like again?

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.060
A sword hung by his waist,

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:38.940
a veil covering his face.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:40.410
There he is!

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.370
Well, that was easy.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.170
The young man in the center,

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:49.810
you stay.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.330
Everyone else, clear out.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:55.220
Let's go.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:56.810
Hey,

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.980
you caused trouble?

00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:58.810
I'll manage.

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:01.500
Please take care of my horse for me.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.090
But...

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:05.170
All right.

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:06.090
Very well.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:08.980
What's your business in Wushuang City?

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:10.810
I ordered a crossbow.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.810
I'm here to collect it.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.460
But someone said

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.460
you came here to cause trouble.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:19.130
Who said that?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.570
Lu Yuzhai, eldest disciple

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.330
of the City Lord.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.810
He blocked my path

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.220
and wanted to test my sword.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:27.810
I refused.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.330
Does that make me a "troublemaker" here?

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.220
You refused?

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:37.740
Well, he claimed

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.170
you broke his spear.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:42.330
To break his spear

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.940
wouldn't even require my sword.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:48.060
And us?

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.500
Come at me all at once.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.980
How amusing.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.850
Jia Zhou. Ye Wuxiu.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:04.300
Lightness.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:10.740
Heaviness.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:28.780
Swiftness.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.300
Now!

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.090
Patience.

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:55.940
Lightness, heaviness, swiftness, and patience.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.540
The four ways of the sword.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.500
Got something to say?

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.020
The Way of the Sword

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.260
cannot be confined to four mere aspects,

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.740
or it will lead to complete defeat

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.170
against a genuine master.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:13.570
What true master?

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:14.890
I am

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:17.460
that true master.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.260
Did your master have you pursue this technique

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:32.810
to seek the way,

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:34.700
or to use you

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.060
to seek his own?

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:38.880
Elder Jian knows

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.410
these four sword styles

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:43.090
would be shattered

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.090
by a true master,

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.700
yet he has us study them anyway.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:49.810
He doesn't intend for us

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.130
to achieve mastery,

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.060
but to hone his own

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:54.850
through our duels.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:55.810

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.260
And that man didn't even

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.260
draw his sword.

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:08.160
Is his swordsmanship

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.700
really that great?

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:11.220

Silence!

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.130
Not a word from any of you!

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.500
I was merely careless.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:30.650
There's no room for carelessness in the martial world.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.460
Chances to survive

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.220
rarely come twice.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.610
When did he take the sword?

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:40.780
Be careful.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.130
Don't let the sword cut you.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.130
This sword is rather sharp.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:46.410
One careless swipe

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.500
might sever your head.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.510
Alas, I still haven't found

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:53.650
anyone worthy of drawing my sword.

If Elder Jian always meant

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:16.260
to use us

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.410
to pursue his own path,

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.850
then what were all our struggles

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.810
and sacrifices for?

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:29.810
We exerted ourselves a lot

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.540
in that duel.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.780
It's reasonable to rest here

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.650
and recover our strength.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.020
Alert the city!

Sound the drums!

Me?

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.500
No, he is seeking to challenge the sword arts of Wushuang City.

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:30.020
This person is no ordinary visitor.

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:32.060
Come, we will see this person together.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.940
The No-Sword City.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.700
A distant yet familiar name.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.170

challenge Wushuang to a duel.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:03.300
Does Wushuang City not even

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.700
have a single swordsman to accept the challenge?

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:08.330
If that's the case,

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.740
better not call it Wushuang City.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.890
Rename it

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.410
"Wugui City"!
[*"Wugui" here refers to cowardice.]

You wish to make a bet.

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:21.130
What's the wager?

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.740
How long till someone

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.060
from Wushuang City steps up to take my challenge?

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.220
Very well.

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:29.300
I'll take that bet.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.460

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.410
I know

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.460
you're that child.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.300
To those who have walked the sword's path for years,

people are like swords.

When I first saw you,

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.330
you were the mold of a fine sword.

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:17.740
Now, I see

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.850
you've become that sword itself.

Do I not deserve it either?

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.610
That depends

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:54.700
on your swordsmanship.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:57.220

No.

Her sword energy is cold and sharp.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.780
It's that boy.

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:44.460
To think

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.500
he survived.

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.300
Elder Jian has gone to confront him in battle.

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:52.170
He told me to inform you.

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:55.460
Jian Shanyue

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.810
cannot stop that sword.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:04.780
Thank goodness.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.020
He's not one of those related to Xueyue City.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:33.810
You have already lost.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.410
Even your father

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:42.570
back then

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:44.780
wouldn't dare speak to me this way!

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.410
How many times have you brought up my father now?

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.220
Thrice you have mentioned him.

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:52.780
What right, pray tell,

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:55.650
do you have to speak of him?

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:56.700
You...

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.330
Don't force me to kill you!

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.300
The Shanyue Sword Technique.

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.810
At last, I've seen it with my own eyes.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:12.410
The Shanyue Sword Technique

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:14.570
may not be enough

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:15.740
to handle that Zhuo Yue'an.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.060
You've reached the summit

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.170
and seen all other peaks below.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.060
But beyond those peaks lie still higher clouds and sky.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.650
If you halt your progress,

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.890
one day, you will inevitably fall from the heights.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.220
Die!

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:04.540
Cease this!

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.060
I came here seeking a duel,

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:15.640
and I've finally met

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.020
someone worth drawing my sword for.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:18.370
I am Song Yanhui

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.060
of Wushuang City.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:22.060
Zhuo Yue'an

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:23.780
of the No-Sword City.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:26.980
The Autumn Water Sword.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.370
Yes.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.980
My father once mentioned you.

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:37.810
Heard you were full of pride in your youth,

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.130
believing that wielding your sword

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.500
could reach the pinnacle of the sword way,

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.370
overlooking all others.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.940
The sword technique you created

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.220
may not have been the greatest in the martial world,

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.700
but the energy of your sword was peerless.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.370
Now,

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.500
the mountains are still high,

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.410
but you've grown old.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:57.740
You no longer live up

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:00.370
to the caliber of your sword.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.300
After today,

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:04.410
Jian Shanyue

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:05.850
will cease to be

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.740
in the martial world.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.890
After today,

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.300
your position as elder of Lunwu Hall

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:14.890
shall be replaced.

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:17.300
It is time for you to retire and enjoy your later years.

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:19.130
I will

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.220
handle this myself.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.220
This is the first appearance

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.130
of the Crane Feather Sword in the martial world.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.170
You are a worthy opponent.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:37.810
When that sword is drawn,

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.260
there is none other that compares.

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.540
The No-Sword City

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:43.060
was a name I greatly admired

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:44.260
in my youth.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:45.610
Sadly,

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:46.890
that mighty sect

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.780
disappeared overnight

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:50.090
from the world.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.740
A tragic loss

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.890
indeed.

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:55.500
Today,

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:57.980
I am honored to meet the Young City Lord

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.130
of No-Sword City.

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:00.260
Why not

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:01.300
come with me

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:03.370
to Wushuang City for a gathering?

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:04.540
Why must we

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:05.850
draw swords

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.090
here?

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.570
Long ago, Wushuang City stood

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:10.290
as the unrivaled capital of martial arts.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.020
Wushuang﻿, "peerless."

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:13.820
But my father used to say

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:15.610
that in terms of swordsmanship,

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.090
he was unmatched in the world.

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.770
For years,

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:21.540
neither could settle the score.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:23.690
Today,

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:26.210
I come to fulfill

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:27.650
my father's last wish.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:29.690
Everyone knows

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.340
that Wushuang City has lost

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:32.730
its "peerless" standing

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.500
in the sword's path.

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:37.960
Even with the rise

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.460
of countless Sword Deities,

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.340
today, I seek only

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.980
to uphold my father's legacy.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:45.860
So, City Lord Song,

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:48.340
please offer your guidance.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.860
From his words,

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:51.340
it seems the fall of No-Sword City

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:53.090
and the present state of Wushuang City are intertwined.

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:55.060
This duel is inevitable.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.460
Should I win,

00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:58.540
the revival of the No-Sword City

00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.540
will ripple

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:00.820
through the martial world.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:02.770
If I lose,

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:04.380
Wushuang City

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:06.380
will lose its title

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:07.610
as one of the Four Greatest Cities for good.

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:10.210
I shouldn't have come.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.690
I've made a mistake.

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:14.090
I used to think my sword

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.290
was burdened with too much,

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:19.500
that every strike couldn't be wielded

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.610
to its fullest.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.090
It wasn't until I wore this veil

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:26.190
and used

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:27.900
my long-forgotten name, Zhuo Yue'an,

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.130
that I felt better.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.020
But seeing you today,

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.420
I finally understand

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:38.170
what my father meant

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:40.210
by the "sword that imprisons oneself."

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:42.730
The sword that imprisons oneself?

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:44.820
To be trapped by one's own making,

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:46.250
imprisoned by one's own sword.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.170
You are a good swordsman.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:50.690
It's a shame.

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:53.020
Yanhui,

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:54.770
you are the lord of a city.

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:56.460
You mustn't unsheathe your sword for just anyone.

00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:58.340
Liu Yunqi.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.170
Ashen Dragon Fang.

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.610
Correct.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.610
This is the Ashen Dragon Fang.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.570
Once, I wielded it

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:15.130
against your father

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.540
for an entire day and night.

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:18.820
In the end,

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.090
we remained evenly matched.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.020
But my father said

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:24.900
he had won.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:26.770
He was ecstatic.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.130
Not because he defeated you,

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:31.730
but because he found someone

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:32.770
who could stride alongside him

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:34.130
in the path

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.210
of the sword.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.690
Nonsense.

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:39.860
If he truly won,

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:42.290
why wouldn't he reveal it to the world?

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.130
Shameless.

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:46.020
Someone like you

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:47.540
doesn't deserve

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:48.480
to stride

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.610
alongside my father.

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:51.420
So be it.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.650
Today, I will defeat you

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.820
and cut your sword in half.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.820
For my father, I will prove

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.090
that the sword of No-Sword City

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:03.020
surpasses Wushuang City.

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:06.610
No-Sword City

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.940
no longer exists.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:09.650
Why do you

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.090
cling to it?

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:12.980
I am still alive.

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:15.540
As long as I live,

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:18.020
No-Sword City still exists.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.690
And the way of the sword my father passed down

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:23.860
shall remain.

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:25.290
Young man,

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:27.170
you're very confident.

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:29.090
You have a fine sword.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.610
It looks like the work of the Villa of Famed Swords.

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:33.940
However,

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:36.420
the sharper the sword,

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.060
the easier it breaks.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.420
Yanhui,

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:41.250
you may withdraw.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.340
Master,

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:44.500
I believe...

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:49.610
I've been nurturing my sword in the Sword Abode for many years.

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:51.720
Today's battle

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.460
is unavoidable.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.130
If he wishes

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.540
to challenge us on behalf of Zhuo Yuluo,

00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.900
then,

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.900
I shall duel him.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.650
However,

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:05.060
by that means,

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:06.980
the outcome

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:08.610
of this duel

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.060
will settle past grievances,

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.650
without bearing on today's Wushuang City.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.250
Is that agreeable?

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:17.380
Very well.

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:20.860
Yanhui,

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:22.460
step back.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:24.860
Yes.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:35.690
I will defeat you,

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.020
and I will kill you.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:37.940
Boy,

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.980
watch carefully.

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:29.860
That young man compelled me

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:30.820
to wield my Shanyue Sword Technique,

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.650
and I glimpsed

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.210
my youthful zeal once more.

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:38.340
But now, his sword has lost

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:39.650
that lofty spirit

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:41.020
and zeal.

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:42.980
It is now filled solely with murderous will.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:44.730
If this continues,

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:46.380
he will surely lose

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:47.610
within ten moves.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:49.690
No.

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:51.980
He's trying to use a single defeat

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.340
to exchange for the death of the Former City Lord.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.090
He isn't using

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:57.130
the sword techniques of No-Sword City anymore.

00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:59.970
He no longer fights with the arts of the true sword way.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:00.860
He intends

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.860
to kill.
