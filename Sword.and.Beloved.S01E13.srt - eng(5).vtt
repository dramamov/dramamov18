yesterday, the Soldier

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.270
was attacked by the Yiqi Alliance
for saving a spider demon.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.000
He left
after being pierced by a thousand swords.

This is interesting.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.480
The Soldier must've hated

after this suffering.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.270

it's the perfect time
to get him on our side.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.040
I heard that the Soldier

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.000
was badly injured
by Quan Jingting's Dragon Qi,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.830
yet accidentally triggered
the Dongfang bloodline

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.290
and got the hang of the Purest Sun Flame.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.350
That helped him make a narrow escape.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.630
Now that his strength
has greatly increased,

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.270
if he can work for you, Madam,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.360

the Yiqi Alliance losing the Soldier

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.600
is like cutting off one arm.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.870

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.200
Seems like

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.320
this village

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.550
is safe for now.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:43.680
Mrs. Qian.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:45.790
Welcome, miss.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.390
Are you here to get tonic?

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:47.790
Yeah.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:48.720
Mrs. Qian,

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.430
these are the handkerchiefs you asked for.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:52.720
So delicate.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:55.240
It's just that our village is too remote.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.000
Otherwise,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.240
you'll definitely be known

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.790
for your embroidery.

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:01.800
Thank you for your support.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.630
By the way,

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.750
is the medicine I asked for ready?

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.410
Yes, I'll get it for you.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:17.890
You look even thinner, don't you?

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.540
How is your husband doing?

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.030
I think

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.200
he needs more time to recover.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.510
It must be hard for you.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.120
New Year's Eve is coming.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.370
It's not easy for a woman
to support the family alone.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:38.470
Mrs. Qian.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.010
What are these?

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.590
These are glutinous rice balls.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.440
It's New Year's Eve soon.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.000
Every household in our village

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.150
will make some of them.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:50.550
It's a symbol of reunion.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:51.950
You should also make some

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:53.270
for auspices,

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.000
in the hope of your husband waking up soon

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.150
to reunite with you.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.720
Mrs. Qian,

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.000
he's not my husband.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:03.270
Not your husband?

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.750
Then who is he?

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:08.250
He's my savior.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.210
Young Master Fugui.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.000
I will light the way for others

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.640
just as you did for me.

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:27.270
For a demon's sake,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.390
you won't even draw the Wangquan Sword.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:31.240
Foolish!

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.550
You're unworthy of being a Wangquan.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.240
Young Master Fugui,

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.510
I'm willing to see lush mountains,
amazing waters,

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:39.480
and snowy deserts with you.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.440
Soldier!

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:41.880
If you want to leave,

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:43.920
you must return everything

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.720
you owe the Yiqi Alliance!

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:47.060
Kill him.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.000
Kill him!

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:48.980
Kill him!

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:49.710
Kill him!

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:50.630
Kill him!

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:52.320
Kill him.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.150
Kill him!

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:54.800
Qingtong!

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.510
This is

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.440
the Purest Sun Flame?

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:43.790
It's still here?

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.800
It seems that during my coma,

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:58.790
the spiritual fire in my body
protected my meridians

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:00.600
and removed that evil energy.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.030
Mother,

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:05.589
so it was you

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.720
who's been protecting me.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.320
Qingtong.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.050
Young Master Fugui.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.200
Young Master Fugui.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.000
You're awake, Young Master Fugui.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.550
I'm sorry.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.080
Sorry, Young Master Fugui.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.350
I'm just so happy to see you awake.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.110
I hurt you without realizing it.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.880
I'm sorry.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.790
It's okay.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:17.910
Young Master Fugui,

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:19.550
you must be hungry

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.730
after lying in bed for so long.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:22.830
Just a moment.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:24.640
I'll make some food for you.

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:26.220
I'll make some food for you.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.290
Young Master Fugui,

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.770
how have your wounds

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:40.920
been healing?

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:41.670
It's fine.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.500
I feel much better now.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:46.890
That's good.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.000
What's wrong?

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:00.480
Young Master Fugui,

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:02.920
I remember

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.550
I saw you with white hair

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:07.480
back then.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.510
The white hair was probably caused
by the collision

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.920
between the invading demonic aura
and the spiritual blood in my body.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.720
I probably
looked terrifying back then, right?

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.640
No way.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:21.790
Young Master Fugui is

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.130
handsome in any way.

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:27.680
Oh, right, Young Master Fugui,

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.610
give me a second.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.610
Young Master Fugui,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.070
you were seriously injured

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:42.400
with your clothes torn.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:44.480
I made you another suit.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:45.830
Check this out

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.030
and see if you like it.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:56.150
Qingtong.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.570
I really like it.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:13.160
Young Master Fugui,

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.770
tonight is New Year's Eve.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.720
People usually make rice rolls.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.480
How about

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.260
we make some together?

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:20.200
Sure.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.030
This is...

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.810
The cobweb barrier was triggered.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.040
The spies from the Silk Cave

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.680
caught up so quickly.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:41.440
Looks like

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:43.030
I can't let my guard down.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.030
Young Master Fugui has just recovered
from fatal injuries.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:48.690
I'd better not tell him for now

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.260
so that he won't worry.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.070
You've done the worst things,

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:10.880
yet you don't look guilty at all.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.590
This is impressive.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.240
Don't you feel

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.790
even a little guilty at all?

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.680
I just took back

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.590
what was supposed to be mine.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.830
Why should I feel guilty?

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:34.730
The Soldier has left the Yiqi Alliance.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.350
Are you planning

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:39.070
to stay in this shabby Sword Tomb forever?

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.720
Have you forgotten

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.510
what Wangquan Hongye did to you?

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.750
My Madam has a brilliant plan

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:47.720
that can help you kill

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.350
Wangquan Hongye.

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.030
I'm all ears.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.200
Our Madam likes

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.530
the way you play along with the situation.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.200
She asked me to tell you a story.

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:12.400
You probably know

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.240
that there's a giant Grief Tree in Tushan.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:18.110
Our Madam was born in this tree.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.720
Unlike other fox demons,

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.000
she was born completely black

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.760
with an innate affinity
to darkness and death.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.750
The Elders of Tushan noticed the anomaly.

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.510
Through divination, they deduced

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.270
that she was born from the world's hatred,

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:34.640
an inborn evil being.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.310
They believed that she'd destroy
the whole world in the future.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:40.270
So, they confined her
to the Heartbreak Cliff of Tushan

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.480
and gave her a seed of the Grief Tree.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.750
They said if she could grow a Grief Tree,

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:46.000
they'd free her.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.150
In the end,

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.960
Madam used her own hatred

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.790
to nurture a huge Black Grief Tree

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:52.440
and found that her own strength

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.510
grew with the tree.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:58.640
From then on, she started gathering
the hatred in the world to feed this tree.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.720
Until that day,

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:03.310
Wangquan Hongye came with the Mask Group
from outside the circle.

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.940
With the mind-controlling dark power,

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.690
Madam killed
almost all the Mask Group members.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:10.310
But unexpectedly,

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:13.200
Dongfang Huaizhu helped Wangquan Hongye
burn his life force

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.270
to pull off the Heaven-and-Earth Strike.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:16.030
That strike

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.150
broke the Black Grief Tree,

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.240
cut off the source of Madam's power,

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.270
and destroyed her body

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:24.480
with only a single wisp of hatred left.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:25.290
Wangquan Hongye felt so guilty

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:26.430
[Wangquan]

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.240
that he lost his Heart of Sword

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.840
and survived pathetically.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:33.440
Madam had been hibernating for years.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.960
And finally, she absorbed
the world's hatred through the Grief Tree

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.110
and woke up.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.070
Because of Madam's resurrection,

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:42.240
the clones left outside the circle

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.680
have been revived.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.720
And you

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.790
have a chance to take revenge.

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.880
I've heard about the story you told.

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:54.400
But even without the Heart of Sword,
Wangquan Hongye is still quite strong

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.480
with a firm grip on the Yiqi Alliance.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:58.960
What's the point

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:00.920
of telling me this?

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:08.350
Back then,
Madam badly injured Wangquan Hongye

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:10.280
with the mind-controlling power.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.070
She can still do the same now, of course.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.720
Think about it.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.780
Only Wangquan Hongye, Li Quzhuo,

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.110
and the Mask Group members

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:21.880
who died outside the circle
know Madam's existence there.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:22.920
No one else

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.070
has really met Madam.

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:28.790
Wangquan Hongye has a scar.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:30.720
All you need to do is

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.070
rub it in.

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:36.070
Now you should know what to do, huh?

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:42.110
These are rice balls, right?

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:42.830
Yes.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.030
So what's the difference
between them and tangyuan?

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:47.070
These rice balls

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:48.480
are bigger.

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:49.880
The round ones

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:52.070
like this are sweet.

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:54.240
This one with a tip is

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.200
salty.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.460
But don't worry, Young Master Fugui.

00:24:58.550 --> 00:24:59.310
I didn't add

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:01.030
any meat to the stuffing.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:02.590
Mm.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.880
It's okay even if there's meat.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.540
From now on,

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.490
we don't have to eat vegetarian food only.

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:13.400
Young Master Fugui.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.940
Do you want to give it a try?

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.640
It's said that making rice balls

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.640
is auspicious.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.830
Okay.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.680
Sure.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:28.570

because they

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.240

Mm.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.200
How's it, Young Master Fugui?

00:27:59.200 --> 00:27:59.860
Delicious.

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:03.850
Why aren't you eating?

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:04.720
Well,

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.840

Young Master Fugui,

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.400
you ate them all?

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:38.350
Yes.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.400
Is there anything wrong?

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.400
Nothing.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.200
Nothing.

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:47.640
Don't you feel anything wrong?

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:49.960
No.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.750
It can't be.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:59.920
It's said
that if you eat rice balls with coins,

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.720
you'll be lucky for a whole year.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.560
If Young Master Fugui gets one,

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:06.730
he will be very happy for sure.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.000
Could it be

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:14.710
that he swallowed it?

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.450
Young Master Fugui,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.920
why is this coin in my bowl?

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:26.950
It seems that in the new year,

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:28.270
Qingtong,

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.680
you'll be lucky.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.200
Did you switch the bowl

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:37.670
when I went to get the spoons?

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:38.880
Qingtong,

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:40.810
this is your good luck.

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:48.400
Then I will share it

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:50.730
with you, Young Master Fugui.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.070
I hope you can be lucky

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:54.840
every day in the future.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:01.270
Thanks.

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.370
Young Master Fugui,

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.440
have some more.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.000
Maybe there are

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:09.610
still some with coins.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:15.170
It's really lively when common folks

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:16.770
celebrate New Year's Eve.

why don't we go hang out

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:22.630
down the mountain after dinner?

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:23.200
Okay.

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:27.240
Great.

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:29.360

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:30.160

It's pretty lively here, isn't it?

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:49.200
Yes.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.370

Young Master Fugui.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.480
Young Master Fugui, look!

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:10.440
What is that?

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:29.930
Are you okay?

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.720
I'm fine.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:36.760

Miss, are you okay?

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:52.550
I see.

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:54.000
This is the Huadeng Village.

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:56.480
would you like to drop by my house?

My father is the village head,
a hospitable host.

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:01.550
Mm.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.920
Okay.

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:03.830
Thank you then.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:04.240
Let's go.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:04.640
Okay.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.010
will definitely become

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.570
the strongest swordsman in the world.

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:05.350
Master.

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:17.110

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.490
what are you doing here?

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:20.790
Master,

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:24.520
before Senior Fugui's departure,

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.200
you barely came here.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:29.110
Senior Fugui's place

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:30.880
was dead silent

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:33.790
most of the time.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:41.010
Now that Senior Fugui is gone,

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.790
you're here again.

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:45.440
Are you

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.550
missing him?

How's it?

-Pretty?
-Come on.

Here you are.

Thank you.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:07.940
Don't mention it, young man.

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:09.670
This is rice tea.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.550
Try it.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:12.800
It's sweet, fragrant, and delicious.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:15.929
Young Master Fugui,

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:17.960
this rice tea tastes really good.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:18.690
Give it a try.

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:19.670
Mm.

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:25.710
This young gentleman

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:28.190
really listens to his wife.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.900
It's not like that, madam.

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:33.190
W-We...

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:34.920
Don't be shy, miss.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.280
Mrs. Qian from the pharmacy said

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.670
that recently, a lady, who's so skilled

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:42.070
in embroidery and lives on the mountain,

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:44.150
often came to trade embroidery

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:45.590
for tonic from her.

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.710
That lady took care of her husband
day and night,

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:50.110
hoping that her husband

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:51.489
could get better soon.

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:53.320
Are you

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:54.880
that young lady?

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.000
I...

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.000
Don't be shy.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.320
In my opinion,

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.230
God

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:04.670
must've been moved by your sincerity.

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:07.230
Judging by this gentleman's complexion,

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:09.030
he must've recovered very well!

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.320
Drink it while it's hot.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:11.710
Mm.

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.880
Xiaolian.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.080
The ritual's starting soon.

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.880
You should go prepare for it.

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:20.800
I almost forgot

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.290
this important matter.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.320
This girl.

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:27.190
Madam.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.710
The village is so bustling
and lively today.

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:31.880
Is there any event?

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:32.800
Yes.

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.940
Our village holds a ritual

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:37.400
on every New Year's Eve.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.960
Everyone will light the lights
and stay up all night.

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:43.070
We'll pray to the River God

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.510
for a year

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:46.320
of good weather

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.880
and peace.

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:51.070
Our River God is amazing.

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:52.360
Thanks to him,

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:53.230
look,

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.880
we're finally leading

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.480
peaceful lives.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:58.840
Madam,

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:00.240
can we

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:02.280
attend this ritual, too?

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:04.110
Of course.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.920
The more people, the better.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.760
We just want to be happy and lively.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:09.920
Great.

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:11.510
Young Master Fugui,

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:12.150
try this.

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:13.230
It's sweet.

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:15.760
Drink it while it's hot.

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.190
Miss, look.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.070
What kind of lantern is this?

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:21.200
It's a rolling lamp.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.320
This year's ritual will be
opened by my performance.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.400
Miss, let me show you.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:24.840
Okay.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:25.390
Let's go.

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:26.590
Young Master Fugui,

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:27.390
I'll go first.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.150
Mm.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:33.070
The rolling lamp is

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:35.150
also called an everlasting light.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.320
Once you light it, you just can't land it.

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:40.870
Otherwise, the River God will be angry.

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:43.350
The ritual tonight

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.280
will be opened by Xiaolian.

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:47.760
Look how amazing she's doing.

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.670
Young man,

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:55.070
would you like
to make a fish lantern, too?

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:56.670
The fish lantern

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:58.320
can carry your wish.

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:00.760
If you offer it to the River God,

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:03.510
he will protect you.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:04.760
Look,

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:06.550
I have all the materials.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:07.530
I'll teach you.

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:08.550
Okay.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.440
Thank you, madam.

I hope that from this moment on,

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:07.190
Young Master Fugui

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.540
will no longer be
disturbed by worldly affairs.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:13.420
I hope he can be free,
travelling around the world

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.630
and pursuing what he wants.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.960
The chicken is ready.

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:31.510
Coming.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.030
The wine is here.

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.070
Young man,

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.030
would you like some rice wine?

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.320
Chief Ma,

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.400
Young Master Fugui never drinks.

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.440
I'll drink with you.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:46.070
Hey.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.280
How can men not drink?

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.360
Yes.

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.420
I usually don't dare to drink too much

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:53.710
because I'm afraid it might
mess things up.

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:57.030
Only during the Spring Festival
will I drink to my heart's content.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.630
Young man,

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.780
will you have a few drinks with me?

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.400
This is our homemade rice wine.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.800
It's really good.

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.190
Miss, young man, just try it.

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.080
-Then I'll give it a try.
-But...

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:09.960
Xiaolian, go get some big bowls.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.290
-Yes, big bowls!
-Okay.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:12.670
Come on.

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:13.030
Hurry.

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:14.360
Big bowls?

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.630
Madam,

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:20.760
Chief Ma,

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:22.070
do you all drink

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:24.230
with such big bawls here?

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.500
This is the real way to enjoy it, Miss.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:27.280
Yes.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.000
We all

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.430
drink with big bowls
and eat meat in big chunks.

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:33.000
Yes.

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.770
Today is New Year's Eve.

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.510
You two came to join us.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.920
Our place is lively and buzzing

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.070
with festive vibes.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:41.030
Let's drink together.

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.490
Come on.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:43.760
Cheers.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.130
Young Master Fugui,

00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.670
how do you feel?

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.510
This wine is a little spicy.

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:08.600
I don't feel anything else.

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:10.000
He can drink.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.930
I heard that my mother never got drunk.

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:15.070
Maybe I'm just like my mother.

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:16.630
Then let's have some more!

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:17.760
Come on, young man.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.280
Cheers.

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:20.800
Young Master Fugui,

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.880
drink less.

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:23.220
Don't worry.

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.280
Xiaolian, do your best.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.030
Yes.

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:58.060
Be careful!

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.750
Xiaolian,

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:12.590
are you okay?

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:13.550
I'm fine, miss.

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:15.440
But I sprained my ankle. I can't dance.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.000
I need you to dance in my place.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:17.590
But...

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:19.600
You can do it. I taught you just now.

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:22.440
Folks,

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:23.760
the rolling lamp didn't touch the ground.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.190
Let's continue the ritual.

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:27.920
Okay.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.320
Mm.

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.670
Mm.

00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:00.960
Nice!

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.920
Bravo!

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:12.880
Nice!

00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:42.360
Nice!

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.840
Bravo!

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:09.920
Bravo!

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:13.710
Nice!

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:15.360
Nice!

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:31.030
Nice!

00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:36.190
Good show!

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:38.630
Bravo!

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.590
So beautiful.

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.670
Amazing!

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:53.810
It's so beautiful.

00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:54.810
Yes.

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:31.760
Young Master Fugui,

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:33.760
have you really decided

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:35.990
to never return to the Wangquan Manor?

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:38.510
I used to only care

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:42.450
about drawing my sword and sheathing it.

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.680
I never thought
that I'd leave the Wangquan Manor.

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:48.250
But no matter what,

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.610
I, Wangquan Fugui, will never change.

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:53.280
I'm no longer

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:55.360
the Soldier deep inside.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:57.880
Even without you,

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:01.130
I would have come this far.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.570
But on this journey,

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:13.420
it's been better having you

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:16.280
by my side.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:26.110
Mm.

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:28.800
Look.

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.530
This fish lantern is so pretty.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.190
Before today,

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:35.880
I never thought
that, besides learning swordsmanship,

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:38.340
I could also learn
how to make fish lanterns.

00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:40.230
Yes.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:41.840
So pretty.

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.360
Actually, Young Master Fugui,

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.440
you're not completely the same as before.

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.150
At least you

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:51.450
smile more now.

00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:58.400
I finally found you,

00:46:58.880 --> 00:46:59.840
Soldier.
