[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.950
[Episode 12]

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.220
I have to go save him!

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.160
It's no use going now.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.350
Yu Qifeng

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.200
has descended into complete madness.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.070
Only Tang Lici can stop him.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.320
Now that the Tianyan Sword Wall
has collapsed,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.450
Sword King City is in imminent danger.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.340
This is all too coincidental.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.760
At this moment,

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.460
we can only trust Tang Lici.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.060
Besides...

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.240
we have more important things

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.990
to do.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.579
I'll go take care of the south!

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:21.070
Senior!

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.079
Haven't you already settled your score

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:23.940
with Foxy Tang?

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.560
Now I owe him again!

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.170
Forget it, forget it.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.770
Let's not talk about it.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.370
What can I say?
I'm handsome and kind-hearted.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.520
Mom!

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.470
Xiaobao!

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.000
Mom!

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.079
Xiaobao!

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.520
Mom!

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.590
Mom!

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.150
Watch out!

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.900
Shen?

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.560
Mom...

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.230
Quick, get to the ferry

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.190
and protect your wife.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.520
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.800
Xiaobao.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.770
Xiaobao, are you all right?

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.310
Come here. It's okay. Don't be afraid.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.870
-Thank you so much!
-Thank you so much!

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:45.280
Hurry!

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.950
Everyone, head to the ferry!

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:47.190
Hurry!

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.840
You're here.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.370
Let's go!

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.120
Take the people to the dock!

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.710
Keep up!

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.910
Follow me! Let's head to the dock!

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:53.800
Go to the ferry!

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.260
Hurry!

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.030
Those in the back,

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.680
keep up!

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.590
Move, move! Quickly!

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.190
Everyone, head to the ferry!

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.630
Run!

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.750
Go!

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.839
Go to the dock!

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.720
Thank you.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.480
Are you okay?

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.360
Thanks.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.350
At a time like this,
you're still worried about luggage?

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.150
Quick, get everyone to the dock!

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.090
Are you alright?

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.480
I'm fine.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.280
Go to the dock!

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:44.480
To the ferry!

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.530
This way!

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.420
Hurry up, hurry up!

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.240
Quick, save them! Hurry!

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.720
Hurry!

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.330
Hurry to the ferry!

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:58.800
Hurry up! Keep close!

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.240
Come on.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.640
Hurry!

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.120
Get up here quickly!

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.800
Little fox,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.970
I've truly gone all out this time.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.190
What a good man I am.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.780
Everyone, keep up.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.750
Get on the boat quickly!

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.120
Be careful! Be careful!

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.810
Those at the back, stay close! This way!

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:19.360
Hurry! Hurry!

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.580
This way!

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.640
Get on the boat now!

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.560
Good.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.740
Hurry, get onto the boat!

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.560
From here on,

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.040
you should be able to manage on your own.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.370
Everyone, keep up!

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:30.830
Keep up with those in front!

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.490
Be careful!

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.570
Commander.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.310
Are there any more boats?

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.720
We've called for all available boats
in the area,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.710
but there are too many people.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.830
Requisition

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:37.750
every available boat

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.810
from all the docks!

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.240
Yes, sir!

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.900
Go quickly!

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.600
Father!

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:42.390
Little girl,

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.000
where are your parents?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.800
Come this way! This way!

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.530
I don't know.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.840
Don't be afraid.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.170
I'll help you find them.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.950
Whose child is this?

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:52.830
My child, hero.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.000
Quick, take her!

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.580
Everyone, board in order!

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.920
Quick, quick, quick!

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.800
This way!

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.590
So many civilians.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.590
How can we manage?

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.120
Until they cross the river,

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.920
none of them is safe.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.450
This way!

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.370
Hurry up! Move!

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.000
Yu Qifeng,

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.160
Liu Yan

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.820
has completely deceived you.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.300
According to his plan,

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.630
whether I live or die,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.180
you'll never be able to leave this place.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.900
He's triggered an avalanche.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.850
Sword King City

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.240
is about to be destroyed!

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.960
Compared to killing you,

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.030
Sword King City is

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.180
a small price to pay!

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.000
Tang Lici!

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.930
My martial arts are unmatched!

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.530
What does it matter
if Sword King City is destroyed?

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.090
The whole world is mine!

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.920
But you...

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.010
look at those people below!

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.390
If you hadn't insisted on

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.050
investigating Sword King City,

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.910
none of this would have happened!

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:23.660
And those people

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.240
wouldn't have died!

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:51.630
That's right.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.720
You've been injured
by the Thirty-Three Heavenly Demon Dance,

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.390
and now you must face

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.270
Yu Qifeng, who's given his all,

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.040
while innocent people

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.170
continue to suffer in Sword King City.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.080
Tang Lici...

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.640
They all died because of you.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.950
It was you.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.510
You were the one who caused their deaths!

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.070
You caused their deaths!

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:33.630
Yu Qifeng,

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.840
I like your reasoning.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.440
Because with it,

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.360
I can kill you

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.760
with a clear conscience.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:13.480
Why?

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.320
I've given everything I have,

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.780
yet I still can't beat you.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:17.840
Yu Qifeng,

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.020
the pill Liu Yan gave you

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.460
has turned you into a drug vessel.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.150
All the toxic blood in your body

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:26.560
will keep you alive

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.730
until the pill's effects wear off.

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.070
But that's all it can do.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:35.910
You're right.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.440
Tang Lici!

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:39.750
I

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.610
have one more move.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.310
Refusing to change until the bitter end.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.030
Everyone, be careful! Run!

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.120
The Westwind Slashing Wildfire,

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.980
born from devouring Yu Xuanqingâ€”

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.880
the sword technique used to

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.610
fiercely battle Yique Yinyang
on Tiandu Peak...

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.320
This time, Yu Qifeng

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.510
has finally impressed me.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.570
And it's worth it...

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.240
With the Sword Phoenix's power,

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.790
this unstoppable techniqueâ€”

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:21.450
Westwind Slashing Wildfireâ€”

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.870
I'll let you taste it first!

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.020
Die!

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.830
Tang Lici is doomed this time.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:53.840
Chi,

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.820
the Tianyan Sword Wall
is about to collapse.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.200
Run!

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:15.370
Get on the boat!

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.520
Hurry, hurry!

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:17.510
Get on the boat!

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:18.910
Be careful! Be careful!

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:24.840
Hurry up, hurry up!

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.600
Run faster!

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.660
Hurry up! Hurry up!

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.080
I've mastered it!

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:35.790
Ancestors,

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:37.240
did you see that?

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.510
I, Yu Qifeng, can split mountains
and shatter stone!

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.270
I'm invincible!

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.080
Light Techniqueâ€”

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.360
Heavenly Sacred Light.

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:38.110
Puzhu is here.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:39.270
Looks like he wasn't

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:40.670
truly driven away by you.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.950
The jianghu will become interesting
from now on.

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:52.170
The rocks are blocked.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.590
Does it have to be this dramatic?

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.480
Puzhu helped.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:03.910
He thinks he can hold back

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.640
the rain of fire all by himself?

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.609
He's being naive.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.770
None of these people

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.900
will make it across the river.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.930
Master, you were right indeed.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:16.829
Wherever Tang Lici goes,

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:19.000
disaster follows.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.020
The Wild Goose Formation.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:49.350
Don't push!

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:50.510
One at a time!

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:51.640
Mr. Chi, Miss Zhong.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:52.110
Master Jiang.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:53.590
Jiang, why are you here?

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.420
I received a message from my benefactor

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.690
saying that help was needed
in Sword King City.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:57.920
Let's get the people
across the river first.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:58.270
Okay.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:17:59.970
Send the signal quickly.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:00.830
Hurry and save the people!

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:01.270
Line up!

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.960
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.270
Move!

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.680
Hurry!

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.270
Everyone, stay calm!

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.350
Master Jiang from the Yanmen Sect

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:07.410
has come to help us!

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.320
Hurry!

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.190
Everything you have

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:30.640
comes from me.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.460
Therefore, you belong to me.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:35.470
What's happening?

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:39.160
What's happening?

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.980
Offer your life to me as a sacrifice,

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:44.570
become a demon,

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.550
and thus achieve true compassion.

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:53.660
The Black Tuli is the product

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.010
of Yique Yinyang's concentrated energy.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.590
Who would have thought that a mortal
could unleash something

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.390
so spectacular by absorbing it?

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.450
I am the true No. 1 in the world!

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:05.440
None of you will

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.830
leave Sword King City alive!

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:07.560
What is that?

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:20.440
Tang Lici,

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.210
have you forgotten our wager?

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:23.740
What on earth are you doing?

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:31.770
This is...

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:41.230
Master.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.240
Yu Qifeng...

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.110
You've destroyed Sword King City's legacy
of generations,

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.640
all for your own delusions.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.170
Was it worth it?

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.530
Why aren't you dead yet?

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:09.850
Who are you really?

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.390
Golden eyes

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:24.790
and a flame mark on his forehead...

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:25.720
Yique Yinyang?

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:27.270
That's right.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.440
Tang Lici

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.660
has always been the successor
of Yique Yinyang.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.350
Yu Xuanqing, the legendary hero

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:40.790
of Sword King City,
fought against Yique Yinyang.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.920
Yet as a descendant of Sword King City,

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:44.590
you've taken the wrong path,

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.160
obsessed with being No. 1

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.320
and craving fame and fortune.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.400
Why?

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:53.730
Why can't I kill you?

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.830
You're a monster.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.240
Monster!

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:00.500
You're just a monster!

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:05.810
â™ª I mind not where I rest my feet â™ª

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.220
â™ª Nor care for wounds or falls â™ª

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.570
â™ª Unafraid of treacherous peaks â™ª

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.160
â™ª I spread my wings and soar â™ª

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.870
â™ª For the righteousness in my heart â™ª

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.080
â™ª Let light envelop all â™ª

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:13.850
â™ª I swear â™ª

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:16.770
â™ª To pierce the clouds above â™ª

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:18.850
â™ª Let my faith â™ª

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.160
â™ª Become a beam of light â™ª

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.020
I've absorbed so much Black Tuli.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:23.440
â™ª My oath â™ª

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.640
My strength rivals the gods!

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.210
â™ª Shall sever grief and pain â™ª

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:28.970
Inner strength can be forcefully enhanced
by drugs,

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:30.670
â™ª I raise my sword â™ª

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:31.750
but the body cannot withstand it.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:32.360
â™ª Before the dawn breaks â™ª

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.020
You've fallen into darkness.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.860
Turn back while you still can.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.060
â™ª Illusions shift â™ª

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:41.460
â™ª Yet here I stand
between heaven and earth â™ª

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.330
â™ª Dawn's first light melts
the heavens above â™ª

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:47.190
â™ª Eternal daylight burns
across the plains â™ª

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:50.040
â™ª To illuminate the endless night â™ª

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.790
â™ª To cut through the bitter, biting wind â™ª

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.710
â™ª To shatter the world
of illusion and ruin â™ª

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.550
The avalanche came to a halt.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.240
-It's stopped!
-We're saved!

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.070
We're saved!

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:13.750
You did it.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.240
Tang Lici,

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.170
the secret you've been carefully hidingâ€”

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:24.810
why not let the whole world

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.080
enjoy it together?

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:49.960
What's going on?

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.160
He has golden eyes and the forehead mark!

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.680
Yique Yinyang?

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.400
Didn't only Yique Yinyang

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:56.920
have those marks?

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.450
Yique Yinyang has revived?

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:02.030
Mr. Tang is Yique Yinyang?

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:09.880
Tang Lici...

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:18.400
Yan...

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:20.830
So

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:23.250
this was your true purpose all along.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.790
[One day later]

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.380
Be careful.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.600
Slow down.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:08.850
Master.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:09.670
Sword Master.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.750
Chunji,

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:11.770
how did Sword King City

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:13.050
end up like this?

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.170
Sword King Yu

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.200
attempted to

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.970
silence everyone to conceal his collusion

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:18.030
with Fengliu Shop,

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:20.390
which led to the city's destruction.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.200
Fortunately, Mr. Tang was there.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.610
Though there were injuries,

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:24.480
no one died.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.510
But why are people saying

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.310
that Tang Lici is Yique Yinyang?

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.400
This matter is still under investigation.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.090
However...

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:33.310
Yu Qifeng

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.040
was indeed the main culprit.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.340
Do you have evidence

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.360
of his collusion with Fengliu Shop?

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.310
The evidence was destroyed.

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:43.160
But Gu Xitan and I

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.090
can both testify

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:44.800
that Yu Qifeng

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.020
was definitely connected to Fengliu Shop.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:46.530
That's right.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:47.920
We examined
all the imperial transport ledgers,

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.750
and the accounts

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.060
were indeed suspicious.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.320
Where are the ledgers?

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.380
They were burned.

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:58.250
So there's no evidence then.

00:24:58.450 --> 00:24:59.510
Without evidence,

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:02.060
we can only rely on
corrupt officials to handle it.

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.360
Why can we only rely on corrupt officials?

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.360
They can extract false confessions
through torture.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.610
Master Shao.

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:15.860
Master Xiao.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:16.960
Master Ji.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.230
I'm Yu Furen.

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:21.750
Master Shao, I heard you've arrived at
Sword King City.

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:23.330
I was occupied with
handling my master's funeral,

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:24.790
so I couldn't welcome you in time.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:26.300
Please forgive me, Sword Master Shao.

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.100
Commander Yu,

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:29.270
I'm deeply sorry

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.570
for the City Lord's death.

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:33.450
Sword Master Shao,

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.790
may I say something?

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.330
Please go ahead.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:37.940
Today, I've

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.920
led all disciples of Sword King City

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:42.990
in wearing mourning clothes
for the Yu family,

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:45.280
and even more so
for the entire martial arts world.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.210
The death of Sword King City's Lord

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.130
and such a tragedy within our city

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.280
were all caused by Tang Lici alone.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.540
I beseech you, Sword Master Shao,

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.310
to severely punish this villain.

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:57.020
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:57.920
If Sword King Yu

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.980
hadn't colluded with Fengliu Shop

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.060
-to sell the Blood Ghost Pill...
-Shut up!

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.750
Everyone knew
Sword King Yu's swordsmanship was

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:05.210
profound and mysterious.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:07.050
Why would he need to rely on
such heretical methods?

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:07.680
But that night,

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.920
at the Qiongtai Banquet,

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.440
we saw with our own eyes
when those people revealed themselves.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.160
And we've

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:12.000
already given that list

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:12.930
to Master Puzhu.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:14.270
May I ask, Mr. Gu,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.260
where is the evidence?

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:17.720
As for Master Puzhu,

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:18.960
he has long since sided

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.790
with Tang Lici

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:20.910
and lost his impartiality.

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:22.110
Did you ever consider

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:24.040
that perhaps Sword King Yu believed

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:24.720
you had been bewitched

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.750
by Tang Lici,

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.270
which is why he risked his life

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:28.310
to protect the city?

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:29.110
Did you ever give him

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.240
a chance to explain?

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.030
Then may I ask, did Sword King Yu

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.720
ever give us a chance to explain?

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.880
If he were truly innocent,

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.620
why would Mr. Tang

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:36.880
have targeted him specifically?

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.920
That's because Tang Lici is

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.250
Yique Yinyang himself!

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:39.920
He wants to use

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.400
Sword King City's imperial transport route

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.720
to distribute the Blood Ghost Pill!

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.330
Yu Furen,

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.550
either you have ulterior motives,

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:47.030
or you're deceiving yourself!

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:47.550
Chunji.

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:51.250
Tang Lici has golden eyes
and the forehead mark!

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.680
The entire city saw it

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.030
with their own eyes!

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.760
Ten years ago,

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.350
Yique Yinyang wreaked havoc
in the jianghu,

00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:59.880
causing untold suffering!

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:00.480
Now,

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.230
he has committed such evil acts again.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.240
Should the Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.480
take responsibility

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:08.930
and issue a warrant for Tang Lici?

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.680
Or perhaps

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.000
you've already been in cahoots

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.130
with Yique Yinyang!

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.690
What are you talking about?

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.350
Whether Tang Lici is Yique Yinyang

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:20.800
has yet to be proven.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.830
As for the Sword King City case,

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:24.630
there are still many questions.

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:25.750
Regarding these two matters,

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.410
I'll investigate thoroughly

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.480
and give both of you

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.240
and the world an explanation.

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:33.030
For now, there's a more pressing matter.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:35.360
The city lies in ruins
and must be rebuilt.

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:38.510
I want to appoint you as acting City Lord

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.130
to temporarily oversee city affairs.

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:42.270
Sword Master Shao,

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:44.230
I'm still young and inexperienced,

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:45.690
unfit for such a position.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.800
That's exactly why I've chosen you.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.970
Only those who dare to
be different in youth

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:51.730
can reach new heights.

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:53.380
But don't worry,

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.090
I'll assign another one

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.640
to govern alongside you.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.540
May I ask, Sword Master Shao,

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.010
who that person will be?

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:02.360
He should be arriving soon,

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:03.580
if all goes well.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.260
[Camellia Island]

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.280
Quick, quick, quick! Kneel!

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:11.070
This is Camellia Island,

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:12.790
where the remnants of the Jile Sect
and followers

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:14.650
of Yique Yinyang are imprisoned!

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:34.940
Sir, you saw

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:36.790
my golden eyes and forehead mark,

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:37.900
yet you didn't kill me.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.430
Why did you save me instead?

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.600
After that great battle,

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:43.710
I went up the mountain to find you.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.430
Within 500 zhang

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.400
of where Yu Qifeng died, nothing grows.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.520
The poison has penetrated 10 zhang
into the ground,

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.960
and its toxicity is
extraordinarily severe.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:53.570
It was you.

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:55.440
You contained that poisonous mist

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.170
within that 500-zhang radius,

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.310
preventing it from
spreading down the mountain

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.680
and harming innocent people.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.740
I've been constantly thinking about

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:03.920
our wagerâ€”

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.040
using my own methods to solve it

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.170
without harming any innocent person.

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.030
You still dare to mention our wager?

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:15.430
You overdrew your power.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.130
Your self-healing ability is
weakening as well.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.110
Moreover,

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.500
the heart crystal inside you

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.480
is continuously

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:25.070
draining your vital essence.

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.930
If not removed,

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.410
you won't live out the year.

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:35.920
Thank you, sir,

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:37.200
for your help.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:40.600
Tang Lici,

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:42.310
come back with me to the Sword Alliance

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.510
to explain what happened to Master Shao

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:46.620
and to account for your connection
to the Zhoudi Tower massacre

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.020
and your relationship with Yique Yinyang.

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:57.920
Sir, the wager we agreed upon is

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:58.680
that as long as you

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.730
intervene in Sword King City's affairs,

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:01.900
you lose.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:03.590
Conversely,

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.510
if within the time limit,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:06.400
I

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.130
fail to deliver evidence to you

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.350
or harm

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:11.200
any innocent person

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.700
in the process of pursuing Yu Qifeng,

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:15.240
then I lose.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.920
Then what of
your "not harming the innocent"?

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.110
Sword King City lies in ruins,

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.510
and the Sword Wall has collapsed.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:21.840
If I hadn't intervened,

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.880
how many civilians would have suffered?

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.480
Indeed.

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:26.490
You intervened.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.590
Doesn't that violate

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:31.920
our original agreement

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.370
that you would never interfere

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.200
in Sword King City's affairs?

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.840
But have you ever considered

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:39.200
what would've happened
if I hadn't intervened...

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.400
I was betting that...

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:42.930
you would definitely step in.

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:51.510
So from the very beginning,

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:52.840
you had already decided

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.400
to include me in your calculations.

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:06.050
That was your own choice, sir.

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:07.470
If it weren't for you,

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.020
Yu Qifeng would have died

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.050
at the Qiongtai Banquet then and there,

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:11.790
and none of these subsequent troubles

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:12.990
would have occurred.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.120
But if you want to break our agreement,

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.880
there's nothing I can do about it.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.410
However,

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:19.400
if you truly believe

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.270
I was wrong,

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:22.550
why did you save me?

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:30.110
Tang Lici,

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.300
you take risks at every turn.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:32.920
Do you really think

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.920
you have everything under control?

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:36.510
Did it ever occur to you that

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:38.030
if even the slightest thing
hadn't gone your way,

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:38.890
how many people

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.400
would have died because of your gamble?

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:43.490
The fact is, no one did.

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:45.230
If that day ever comes...

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:48.230
you won't be able to pay the price.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.750
To be honest,

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.240
I don't even care.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:57.680
Tang Lici.

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.090
Sir, let me ask youâ€”

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:04.220
weren't those

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:05.790
who died

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:07.550
from the Evil Pill's poison

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:08.610
innocent victims?

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.360
Weren't those who died
because of Fengliu Shop

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:12.560
innocent?

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:14.000
Chi Yun,

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:15.780
Shen Langhun,

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:17.640
Zhong Chunji, Gu Xitan,

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.680
and Sheiâ€”

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:20.560
they risked their lives

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:22.050
to fight against Yu Qifeng

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:23.110
and Fengliu Shop.

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:24.930
Aren't they innocent?

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:27.520
In the battle at Tiandu Peak,

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.000
more than half of the Seven Masters

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.330
were injured or killed.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:31.250
Fang Zhou

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:33.600
was severely wounded because of it.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.000
Should their sacrifices

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:36.960
be taken for granted?

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:39.180
They were heroes.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.500
They chose to stand against evil.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.180
But once I take action,

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.030
it won't be

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:48.420
just heroes who perish.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.810
I cannot agree with your thinking.

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:53.230
Is that so?

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.360
Then please allow me

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.840
to decline your invitation.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:01.880
I...

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.440
will never go to
the Sword Alliance with you.

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:09.110
I'm afraid...

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:11.640
that's not up to you.

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:16.200
My rivalâ€”

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.550
the very one the Sword Alliance

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:20.960
has been painstakingly searching for,

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.420
the owner of Fengliu Shopâ€”

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:24.030
why would he

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:25.200
reveal my golden eyes and forehead mark

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.030
to everyone?

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.840
Master Puzhu, you're clever,

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:30.530
so surely you understand.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.750
They want to use the Sword Alliance

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:33.640
to restrain me

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.530
and ruin my reputation.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.450
If I were to follow you back now,

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.720
wouldn't I be

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.520
playing right into their hands?

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:44.590
How about

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:46.070
we

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.790
make another wager?

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:50.310
What wager?

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:13.489
With my current strength,

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:15.150
I'm no match for Tang Lici

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.230
or Puzhu.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:17.560
Master...

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.710
I'll definitely avenge you.

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:26.570
Father.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.630
Tang Lici!

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:40.480
What are you doing here?

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:41.310
Commander Yu.

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:43.239
Tang Lici's accomplice...

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:45.540
Given what lies between us,

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:46.920
I don't see the need to explain.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:47.719
Commander Yu!

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:50.620
Move aside.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:51.900
Please hear me out.

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:53.550
After Sword King Yu's death,

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:54.880
Madam Bai disappeared.

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:56.469
I heard she has no parents

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.960
and was taken as a concubine

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.000
by Sword King Yu solely for her beauty.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.280
Regarding Sword King Yu,

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:01.840
I think...

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:02.480
Mr. Gu!

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:05.840
Yique Yinyang has reappeared
in the jianghu.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.800
With such important matters at hand,
you pay them no mind

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.510
and instead concern yourself

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:09.760
with my master's private life?

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:10.360
This isn't just

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.320
your master's private life,

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.120
Commander Yu.

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:14.150
Why don't you think about it?

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:15.510
Madam Bai's background is unknown,

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:17.190
and now she's disappeared without reason.

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.800
Is there truly nothing suspicious
about that?

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.150
Could she be a pawn sent by Fengliu Shop

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:21.590
to control Sword King Yu?

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:23.880
Perhaps she was afraid
Fengliu Shop would be implicated,

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:24.590
so she burned

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:26.650
the accounts we were investigating.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:29.510
Absurd.

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:54.960
Your vital energy is severely damaged,
your power has diminished,

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.930
and your self-healing ability
has been affected.

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:58.190
Take care of yourself.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.440
The world beyond these walls

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.500
doesn't favor you.

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:02.760
Once you leave here,

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.040
I won't be able to protect you.

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:07.310
Thank you for your concern, sir.

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:38.590
Lici.

00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:39.800
Lici.

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.070
Who are you?

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.520
He's discovered you. He's discovered you.

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:49.960
No, I don't want to.

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:51.630
No, I don't want to!

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.360
Tang Lici,

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.370
look at those people below!

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:57.510
If it weren't for you

00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:59.150
insisting on
investigating Sword King City,

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:01.010
none of this would have happened!

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:04.070
Those people wouldn't have died!

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:10.960
Tang Lici,

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.840
you can't save anyone!

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:16.030
Tang Lici,

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:18.400
if not for you,
Fang Zhou wouldn't have died!

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.030
Lici,

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.190
don't reveal your golden eyes
and forehead mark.

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.920
Fang Zhou...

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:24.280
I'm sorry.

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.550
I didn't do as you said.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:32.040
No one will die because of me.

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.290
If I can save them...

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:37.240
I can save you.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:43.760
Here.

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.030
Thank you.

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.800
Next.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Thank you so much.

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:51.880
Thanks.

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:04.400
Have some.

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:16.450
I never expected

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.080
that order in Sword King City

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.480
would actually

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.880
be restored

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:21.160
in such a short time.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.610
It's truly remarkable.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:24.110
Master.

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:25.920
Then I should

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.380
introduce someone to you.

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:28.030
Who?

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.280
Miss, where is Dr. Liu?

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:36.540
Divine Doctor Liu is over there
treating patients' hands.

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:37.360
Could you check on me?

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:37.960
It's done.

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:39.370
Please sit down first.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:40.580
That's him.

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.590
Him?

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.180
That young man in white

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:45.110
not only treated

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:45.880
the injured

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.190
but also gathered everyone
to set up shelters

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:49.550
and collected and distributed food

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:50.670
so that no one would go hungry.

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:51.400
That's good.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:53.800
Dr. Liu!

00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:00.200
Avoid water for three days.

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.070
Everyone, please wait a moment!

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:03.230
-You attend to your business first.
-Alright, alright.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:04.290
Alright, alright.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:10.920
Master,

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:12.510
this is Dr. Liu.

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:15.360
Dr. Liu,

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:16.720
thanks to your help,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:17.920
the people here

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.580
can still receive treatment.

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:22.090
I've only made a small contribution.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.360
Master Shao, the martial arts world today

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.480
remains at peace precisely

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.630
because of your wise governance.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:26.400
We've finally enjoyed

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.800
nearly 10 years of peace.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.800
This is by no means my effort alone.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:31.320
Many

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.070
talented heroes like yourself

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.170
have also contributed.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.840
I'm afraid

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:38.570
those days of peace

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.240
are coming to an end.

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:45.190
Dr. Liu, you're worried

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:46.190
that the Blood Ghost Pill

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:48.210
will harm the martial arts world again?

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:48.610
Yes.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.920
But not only that.

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:53.150
All healers know

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.800
we must treat the root cause
of an illness.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.130
Without Yique Yinyang,

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:58.210
there would be no Blood Ghost Pill.

00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:59.400
Master Shao, I'm sure

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.630
you know the calamity

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.360
Yique Yinyang

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.900
caused ten years ago better than I do.

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:06.670
The reason he

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:07.800
was able to gather

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.400
so many followers so quickly

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:11.360
was not merely the court's favor

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.230
but, more importantly,

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:13.710
his deceptive nature.

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:16.710
He killed with one hand
while saving with the other,

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:18.030
winning people's hearts

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:19.560
while deceiving the world.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:22.550
Now look at Tang Lici.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:25.610
He uses the court's name as protection

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.370
and commits heinous crimes

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:29.280
under the pretense of justice.

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:31.370
Yique Yinyang is indeed dead,

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:33.400
but Tang Lici's current methods

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:34.630
are identical to those

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:35.630
of Yique Yinyang.

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:36.760
Not to mention,

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:39.000
he revealed his golden eyes
and forehead mark.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:39.710
Even if he isn't

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:40.840
Yique Yinyang himself resurrected,

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.770
he must be deeply connected to him.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:45.530
Master Shao.

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:49.110
To address the root of this problem,

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:51.190
I earnestly request that you

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:53.140
issue an arrest warrant
throughout the jianghu

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:54.660
to apprehend Tang Lici.

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.880
Dr. Liu, what you've said
is merely speculation.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.150
A few connections

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:09.880
cannot make a conclusive case.

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.510
If we rashly issue an arrest warrant
throughout the jianghu,

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:14.840
people might become even more unsettled.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Indeed, Dr. Liu.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:18.110
Sword Master Shao, you believe

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:19.570
Tang Lici is a good person?

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.110
I truly do not wish to pass judgment

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:29.510
on someone I've never met

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:31.000
without proper cause.

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:32.800
Master Shao.

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:39.320
Please hear what this old woman
has to say.

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.550
Madam, who are you?

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.590
My son was Qin Kunwu.

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:46.670
Mr. Qin was a hero

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:48.590
who fought against
the Jile Sect rebellion.

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:50.230
Mr. Qin was truly a righteous man.

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.840
Indeed.

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:52.930
Mr. Qin had a heart for the people.

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.670
I deeply admire him.

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:55.560
Back then,

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.630
if he hadn't sacrificed his own life

00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:59.000
to hold back Yique Yinyang

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.320
at the Battle of Tiandu Peak,

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.510
we might never have succeeded in
killing him.

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:03.000
Yes.

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:06.510
Kunwu was my only son.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.920
The night before
the Battle of Tiandu Peak,

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.320
he stood outside my room,

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:12.080
hesitating for a long time.

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:14.800
I asked him

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.590
why he wouldn't come in.

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:18.840
He said

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.150
he couldn't face me.

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:25.920
He couldn't bear to leave me alone,

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:28.190
but for the sake of
the entire martial arts world

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:29.710
and its sliver of hope,

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.150
he had to risk his life.

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.110
And he did it.

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:35.880
I was

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:37.950
very proud.

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:40.510
The peace in the martial arts world

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:42.670
was bought with my son's life,

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:45.480
as well as the lives

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.340
of many heroes!

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.230
Master Shao,

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:49.550
I want to ask you:

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.190
doesn't the worth

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:52.800
of all those lives

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.190
outweigh that of one Tang Lici?

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:57.280
Must we really wait

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:00.440
until Yique Yinyang makes a comeback

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.410
before sacrificing

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:06.510
countless more lives to fight back?

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:09.000
-Issue a warrant for Tang Lici!
-Issue a warrant for Tang Lici!

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.190
Everyone!

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.670
I, Shao, hereby order

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:32.710
the arrest of Tang Lici.

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:34.000
If necessary...

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.440
kill without mercy!

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:41.480
-Good!
-Yeah!

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.280
-Good!
-Good!

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.400

-Yeah!

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.070
-Good!
-Good!
