Since you didn't understand, I'll say it clearly.

Studying isn't everything.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.590
You did dance too, why keep pushing academics?

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.630
Hey, I did dance because I was good at it.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.230
If I hadn't injured my ankle,
I wouldn't be your mom today.

Since you're not good at anything else,
you should at least study well.

You draw well.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.460

Yeah, I guess I am.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.160

You got your hopes up?

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.250
What hopes?

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.853
When he was hesitating, you thought he'd say,

00:12:00.853 --> 00:12:04.050
'I like you,' didn't you?

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:06.370
No, I didn't.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.050
Yeah, right.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.430
I don't know.

00:12:14.813 --> 00:12:17.040
U Yeon!

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.013
What are you doing?

00:12:19.013 --> 00:12:20.626
Hey.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.253
Darn it.

00:12:26.253 --> 00:12:28.950
Hey, you can make up for a mistake.

00:12:30.546 --> 00:12:32.650
What was my mistake?

00:12:33.386 --> 00:12:35.860
You weren't acting like yourself.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.970
Your charm is blunt honesty,

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:47.110
but you beat around the bush like someone else.
She probably thought you were joking.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.330
Even I'd get mad.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.040
You should've just said how you felt,

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.120
straight and simple, like you always do!

00:12:59.093 --> 00:13:01.190
My true feelings?

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:03.110
Yeah.

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:04.530
It's not too late.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.213
Fix it fast,

00:13:07.213 --> 00:13:10.946
and go poop, Gi Jeong. Okay?

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.693
[This week's dress code, 'historical drama']

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.613
Spirit Fingers' dress code for this week
is is historical drama.

00:13:26.613 --> 00:13:28.520
Where am I supposed to find a hanbok?

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.410
Wow, we're getting sponsored outfits.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.010
Our Artist Song sure lives lavishly.

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:44.360
U Yeon, how about we pick a theme like
they did and try it ourselves?

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.970
Good idea.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.570
- Not bad.
- I like it.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:50.570
Let's just make our group
a sub-organization of Spirit Fingers.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.050
Oh!

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.413
That's a pretty good idea.

00:13:53.413 --> 00:13:56.270
So U Yeon is basically the founder of the group?

00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.670
Hey.

00:14:00.546 --> 00:14:02.493
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:09.050
I knew our legend would make
waves with this teaser.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.270
Check the number of likes.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.020
Wow, look at this face.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.506
Ah, I'm dying.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.010
Huh?

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.880
Why did he come here?

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.200
Huh?

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.413
Why are my eye pranking me?

00:14:33.413 --> 00:14:35.960
Oh, you can't take pictures.
You can't take pictures.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.960
Bring your phone.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.580
Ah, the ugly one should just sit this out.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.600
Isn't that him?

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.600
U Yeon.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.240
Hey, Miss Piggy.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.000
Stand over there.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.560
That lunatic.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.800
Song U Yeon.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.286
What? Why is he here?

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.980
Why'd you come all the way here
and make a scene? Embarrassing.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.144
Embarrassed?

00:15:10.144 --> 00:15:14.260
Wow. Hey, am I the embarrassing one?

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.906
You're the only girl
who'd ever feel ashamed of me.

00:15:16.906 --> 00:15:19.200
If that's all you came to say, leave.

00:15:20.213 --> 00:15:24.053
I came to apologize face-to-face.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.380
Apologize for what?

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:30.640
Did my confession sound like a joke to you?

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:31.760
Huh?

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.620
- It's real.
- What is?

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.860
He wasn't looking good
because of the photo edits or a filter.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.100
Seriously, why is someone that amazing
mixed in with ordinary people?

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.580
Are things going well?

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.853
Wow, even his friend's gorgeous.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.373
Darn it.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.480
Those two seem to have a good vibe, don't they?

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.413
Hey.

00:15:55.413 --> 00:15:59.560
Ugh, the goddess is over there.
Why pick some plain girl?

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.613
Where's this goddess?

00:16:01.613 --> 00:16:03.693
Ah, that girl with the long hair.

00:16:03.693 --> 00:16:06.560
Long hair, looks like a top student?

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.700
How is that a top student look?

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.423
She's just a goddess.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:19.650
Hey, Byeon Soon.

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:21.653
I think that she's been checking me out.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.350
Did you think I was kidding?

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.890
You knew what situation I was in that day.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.520
But did you really want to mess with me like that?

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.410
What if I was serious?

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:40.270
Serious about what?

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.720
- Let's...
- Huh?

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:48.386
Let's...

00:16:48.386 --> 00:16:51.390
Don't tell me... he's asking me out...

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:53.160
Let's...

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.660
get married!

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.980
Let's get married!

00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:07.570
I hate it!

00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:09.613
Hey.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.080
Hey, Gi Jeong!

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.840
'Like me, not Seong Ho?'

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.670
Come on, that's clearly a confession.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:27.520
Honestly, I thought the same at first.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.660
But look at today.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:29.860
He straight up said 'Let's get married'.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.240
It does feel a bit out of nowhere.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.641
Totally something an elementary kid would do.

00:17:32.641 --> 00:17:34.100
He even brought friends along.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.280
Mi Rae.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.400
What do you think?

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.900
Not sure about other things,

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.320
but I want to join that club too.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.125
- Spirit Pinger, or whatever?
- Huh?

00:17:44.125 --> 00:17:45.200
Why are you going there?

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.711
Song's going. Why can't I?

00:17:46.711 --> 00:17:48.280
My friend, take me with you.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.700
Ugh, stop being so clingy.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.420
You have zero interest in drawing.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.950
You just want to check out guys, right?

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:54.786
Song's only going there for guys too!

00:17:54.786 --> 00:17:56.940
She joined there because of that guy, Blue Finger.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.440
At first it was that,

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.100
but now I go there because sketching's fun.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.681
Ah, what a lie.

00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:03.700
- Or maybe she switched to the Poop Boy.
- Hey, Jo Mi Rae.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.000
Are you going to keep talking like that?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.460
Song's already feeling awkward.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.320
Why do you always pick on me?

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.340
Are you Song's guardian or something?

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.020
Stop fighting, guys.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.760
I'll ask him right now.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.080
Hey, if you think you can skip
and just model, you're wrong.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.480
You have to do the sketching too.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.020
Last time I checked,
everyone was terrible except for that guy.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.240
I could draw better than that even with my feet.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.840
What?

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.169
- Take back what you just said.
- Huh?

00:18:28.169 --> 00:18:30.360
I said take it back.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.733
Well,

00:18:31.733 --> 00:18:34.730
it was a joke, why are you so serious?
You're embarrassing me.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.260
Everyone worked really hard on their drawings.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.180
Don't talk like that, dismissing their effort.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.160
You think you're so great, huh?

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.912
Mi Rae.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.240
- What?
- Hey, you fool.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.680
You should've asked to date first.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.281
How can you say 'let's get married'?

00:19:03.281 --> 00:19:05.640
But you said to be direct with my feelings.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.520
I mean, doesn't dating lead to marriage anyway?

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.240
Oh my god, you fool.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.373
Are you trying to be funny?

00:19:12.373 --> 00:19:14.100
Ugh, forget it.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.060
Get lost.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.820
This isn't working.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.420
Let's go.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.300
Get out here fast, dude.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.840
Stay still.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.980
Did I even need to contact her?

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.120
You came, sis?

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.666
He got caught up with a girl?

00:19:44.666 --> 00:19:46.440
Is that for real?

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.040
Sis.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.200
I-I understand your feelings,
but he needs to live too.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.860
Who is it? Who's that smart kid
living life properly?

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.640
Yeah, she's the who joined
the same art group as him.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.900
She's called 'Miss Piggy'.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.180
'Piggy'?

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.420
Don't tell me... 'Piggy'?

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:07.500
Is she really that 'Piggy'?

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.440
Yes, but it seems like she has a crush
on another boy in the same group.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.400
A crush?

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.776
Come on! Get up!

00:20:15.776 --> 00:20:19.380
Gosh. Darn it.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.380
This won't do. First, let's do an enema.

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.520
Are you insane?

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.780
It feels like I was just
changing your diaper yesterday.

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.160
Our baby's grown so much.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.400
What are you saying?

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.520
Hey, you lonely heart.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.706
Girls always run away if you push too hard.

00:20:37.706 --> 00:20:41.106
What? You're giving advice
after getting played by a playboy?

00:20:41.106 --> 00:20:44.506
I'm trying to be serious here,
why bring up the past?

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.560
I'll let it slide out of pity.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.100
Go away.

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:54.520
Hey, you think 'Piggy' is the kind of kid
who changes her mind so easily?

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.040
There's no way she went from liking khaki
yesterday to liking red today.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.200
What nonsense is that?

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.820
They said Piggy's crush is in the same group.

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.720
Isn't that Khaki?

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.880
Hey, go home.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.401
You clueless green pig.

00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:12.200
You're making my condition worse.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.800
Can't even poop properly, seriously.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:24.430
'Hey', 'you'?

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:26.530
You punk, I went easy on you 'cause you were sick.

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:28.510
Do you want to die? You little...

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:39.390
Why did you call her?

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:42.550
Exactly.

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:55.010
You're lying.

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:57.573
Or maybe she switched to the Poop Boy.

00:21:57.573 --> 00:21:58.910
I let it slide once.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.270
Hey, it was a joke, why are you so serious?
You're embarrassing me.

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:04.390
Everyone worked really hard on their drawings.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:05.826
Don't talk like that, dismissing their effort.

00:22:05.826 --> 00:22:07.670
You think you're so great, huh?

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:10.053
You nasty girl.

00:22:10.053 --> 00:22:12.810
Let's get married.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:14.510
You little punk.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:19.790
Since you're good at nothing else,
shouldn't you at least study well?

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:34.630
I have feelings too.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:36.530
I have feelings!

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:45.340
Are your feelings just like coal ashes
to be kicked around?

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.140
Everyone treats me so carelessly.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.426
Everyone talks to me too easily.

00:22:53.426 --> 00:22:56.146
I get hurt too.

00:22:56.146 --> 00:23:00.420
I also have my pride.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:04.040
But you're the one who made them think it was okay

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.120
to treat you like that, right?

00:23:07.786 --> 00:23:09.746
So...

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.920
it's all my fault then, huh?

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:39.110
Hey, Green Pig.

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.290
Hey!

00:23:44.786 --> 00:23:45.840
What time is it?

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.260
Wake up Tae Seon and send him to school.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.800
Because of you,
he's out there sleeping in the dew.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.780
Ugh, annoying.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.360
What about you?

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.770
It's not about liking or disliking.

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.040
Piggy doesn't really know you yet, you know.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.510
Just try getting closer step by step.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:12.610
I thought we were close enough already.

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:17.110
Well,

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:19.310
I don't think that's enough yet.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:23.750
Seeing that she doesn't know
how decent a guy you are.

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:29.110
If she really knew you, she'd know

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:32.213
my brother is quite an awesome guy.

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:36.490
So, try getting a little closer to her.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.950
Now I shall take my leave.

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:46.630
Ah, go take a poop first.

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.510
Stop making your sister worry.

00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:00.030
Byeon Tae Seon, wake up.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:01.650
Hey, and who wrote 'Green Pig' there?

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:05.120
If I catch whoever did it,
I'll cover their face in spray paint.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.560
That you're actually a decent guy.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.480
That you're pretty cool.

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:34.080
There's no one cooler than you in this world.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.740
Do you feel the urge?

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.260
Let's go to school.

00:26:19.226 --> 00:26:21.030
You go ahead.

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:28.470
Do you know why I was so angry?

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:31.527
Spirit Pinger or whatever, how long have you
known those people to be taking their side?

00:26:31.527 --> 00:26:32.650
I was super hurt.

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:34.866
You think I wasn't hurt by you?

00:26:34.866 --> 00:26:38.670
- What?
- If the listener gets hurt, it's not a joke.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:40.386
Why do you always talk to me like that?

00:26:40.386 --> 00:26:41.750
Do you know how hurt I feel every time?

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:43.810
Unbelievable.

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:47.351
- You should've said something! Why endure?
- Because you're my friend.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.670
Just because I laughed it off
doesn't mean I wasn't hurt.

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:52.850
I held back because I didn't
want to fight with my friend over this.

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:54.510
Wait a second.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.551
Calm down. Mi Rae, you too.

00:26:56.551 --> 00:26:57.770
Yeah?

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:00.890
You must've had a hard time being friends
with someone as mean as me.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:03.430
- If you hated it, why didn't you say so?
- Hey.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:04.530
No need to hold back anymore.

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:06.750
I won't ask to be friends anymore.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:11.270
Try being buddies with Miss Perfect
and Miss Suddenly-Popular.

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:13.510
Hey, Jo Mi Rae.

00:27:47.626 --> 00:27:49.426
Mom says it's time to eat.

00:27:49.426 --> 00:27:51.040
U Dol.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:52.830
Come here for a sec.

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:54.430
Why?

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:56.750
Ah, what?

00:28:05.626 --> 00:28:08.510
How many friends do you have?

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:09.510
Zero.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:10.510
Still?

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:11.610
Haven't made a single friend?

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:13.430
I chose not to.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:15.066
Since when is Seong Gwan Sik a friend?

00:28:15.066 --> 00:28:18.550
Maybe if there were someone
helpful like Se Ra, then yeah.

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:21.070
Do you really think that?

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:23.090
U Dol.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:24.432
I don't need that.

00:28:24.432 --> 00:28:30.146
Mom says relationships can be such a headache.

00:28:30.146 --> 00:28:32.760
So why waste time on that?

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.790
There's no benefit to it at all.

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:37.050
Why suddenly talk about friends?

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:38.250
Did you fight?

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:41.853
Well, probably not Se Ra.

00:28:41.853 --> 00:28:43.630
With that Jo Mi Ryo?

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:46.080
Why call my friend like that?

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.410
Good.

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:48.570
Just end the friendship.

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.451
That girl really doesn't help you at all.

00:28:50.451 --> 00:28:51.550
Hey.

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:55.670
Otherwise, you'd keep getting pushed around
and living like a pushover.

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:17.070
Sorry.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:19.730
Did I just interrupt you
while you were studying, genius?

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:26.250
Hey, I already said I'm sorry.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.590
Are you ignoring me?

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:28.770
Ah, sorry.

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:30.850
I've never learned the language of lower animals.

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:33.190
Animals?

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:34.930
You really wanna die, punk?

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:36.370
If you hit him, the principal will scold you.

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:37.505
Let go.

00:29:37.505 --> 00:29:39.610
Hey, think being a genius excuses everything?

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:41.130
Does it?

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:43.290
Guys.

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:44.970
Teacher's coming.

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:47.560
If you fight, you'll get in trouble.

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.590
You'll get in trouble.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:51.190
You'll regret this.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:02.413
Today in art class,
we'll try drawing our friends' faces.

00:30:02.413 --> 00:30:04.490
Everyone has their crayons
and sketchbooks out, right?

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:06.350
Yes.

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:09.106
Discuss with your partner,
decide the order, then start drawing.

00:30:09.106 --> 00:30:10.390
Yes.

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:12.990
- U Dol, want to work with me?
- Yes.

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:14.270
Miss, miss.

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:15.411
Oh, right.

00:30:15.411 --> 00:30:17.870
Since Eun Seo's absent, Bong Gu's alone.

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:19.530
Perfect. You two can work together.

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:21.130
Come here.

00:30:25.052 --> 00:30:26.973
Hi.

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:30.130
Hey, look at them.

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:31.370
Hello.

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:35.400
Wow, so many colors.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.820
Wipe your nose.

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.000
It's too messy for me to draw.

00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:59.373
Hey, are you crying?

00:30:59.373 --> 00:31:01.250
Why cry?

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:05.750
It's my first time getting a gift like this...

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:07.390
- I'm touched.
- What?

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:09.790
I'll cherish it forever.

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:12.224
Gotta keep precious stuff in my undies.

00:31:12.224 --> 00:31:14.530
Treasure undies.

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:17.470
- Hey, you should sit and draw.
- Treasure undies.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:19.070
Got it.

00:31:34.074 --> 00:31:37.780
Sorry, U Dol. Moms kept
holding me back again today...

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.380
I was not expecting it.

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.340
Ah, U Dol.

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:48.520
The moms say there's a kid
in your class who's slow?

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.780
Doesn't he bother anyone?

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.060
Who?

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:55.280
There's like 20 slow kids.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.680
20... Oh, right, right. True.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:03.040
Oh, compared to our U Dol,
everyone else is lacking anyway. Moms just forgot.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.213
What's that kid's name again?

00:32:05.213 --> 00:32:07.780
Was it Bong Sik or Bong Gu?

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:11.280
Well, they said he's unhygienic and can't read?

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.300
What on earth are his parents doing?

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.620
Your homeroom teacher is a problem too.

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:18.760
Why even keep a special class?

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.300
They should've sent him there.

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.600
How's that supposed to create
a study-friendly atmosphere?

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.540
I'm tired.

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:25.573
I just want to go quietly.

00:32:25.573 --> 00:32:26.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.080
Sleep tight.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:29.780
Ta-da!

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.160
Wow, amazing.

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:37.620
Hey, Mi Rae.

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:39.360
Your friend's here?

00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:47.610
Song's never gotten mad at you before, right?

00:32:49.386 --> 00:32:50.570
If you're lecturing, I'm leaving.

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.470
She's gotten mad at me before.

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:55.690
In middle school.

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:59.130
When my parents divorced, I almost went astray.

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:03.930
Hung out with troublemakers,
went places teachers would faint knowing about.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:08.730
Wanted to self-destruct,
so my parents would regret it.

00:33:09.386 --> 00:33:10.440
But...

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.050
Where should we go?

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:14.626
- Should we go where we went last time?
- Oh, that singing room?

00:33:14.626 --> 00:33:15.990
Yeah, let's go.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:18.413
Yeom Se, you're skipping academy.
Where are you going?

00:33:18.413 --> 00:33:19.850
I'll handle it.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:21.750
Stop worrying.

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:25.070
Snap out of it, Yeom Se Ra!

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:29.790
She exploded in anger like a different person.

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:31.773
That was our first big fight.

00:33:33.106 --> 00:33:35.506
Thinking back,

00:33:35.506 --> 00:33:39.106
I guess Song must have felt pretty bad to do that.

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:42.410
That's when I realized.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:48.546
'Something's wrong with me.'

00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:02.010
And when you started fangirling,
Song was really lonely too.

00:34:10.973 --> 00:34:12.890
Where'd you disappear to?

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.010
Did you meet Mi Rae? How is she?

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:19.290
If I apologize, do you think she'll accept?

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:21.950
Why get mad if you'd apologize in a day?

00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:23.430
If so, just endure it.

00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:25.320
Nothing you said yesterday was wrong.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.691
Let her apologize first.

00:34:26.691 --> 00:34:30.573
Mi Rae needs time to realize things too.

00:34:30.573 --> 00:34:33.370
But what if she really cuts ties?

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:35.350
She won't.

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:39.070
What happened to Nam Gi Jeong?

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:41.440
No contact since that day?

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.136
Yeah.

00:34:43.136 --> 00:34:45.910
That was a confession,
but why do you keep missing it?

00:34:45.910 --> 00:34:48.186
Saying 'let's get married' was a bit much.

00:34:48.186 --> 00:34:50.610
I think it fits his character to say that.

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:52.410
A, a confession!

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.013
No, it's not.

00:35:00.426 --> 00:35:03.280
He says...

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.150
I'm pretty.

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:08.450
- So what?
- There's no way he'd say that, right?

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:12.680
There are so many pretty girls around.
How could I be one of them?

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.341
- So that was just a joke...
- What does that have to do with anything?

00:35:14.341 --> 00:35:17.510
He probably only sees you as pretty.

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:19.333
So what if he thinks you're pretty?

00:35:19.333 --> 00:35:21.930
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:29.630
Both you and Mi Rae are caught in traps right now.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:31.590
What kind of trap?

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:33.773
The trap of inferiority complex.

00:35:33.773 --> 00:35:35.626
Let's go.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:53.190
There's no in-between, none at all.

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:55.440
He's really hyped today.

00:35:57.293 --> 00:36:00.430
Okay! Let's call it a day!

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:03.546
Okay! Ah, nice, nice!

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:06.830
How come all today's takes are A-cuts?

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:09.470
Nam Gi Jeong, what's going on?

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:10.770
Why are you so excited today?

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:13.090
There's someone I need to show...

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:16.370
Can you meet me briefly today?

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:19.450
There's someone I need to show how awesome I am.

00:36:21.146 --> 00:36:23.030
Oh, Ye Rim's here?

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:25.053
Ye Rim, let's take a 20-minute break.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.750
Hi, Ye Rim.

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:28.350
Hi, guys.

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:32.570
Gi Jeong, I need a quick consultation.

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:35.213
I'm a bit busy right now.

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:38.610
You can at least do a quick consultation, right?

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:42.050
Don't you have that much responsibility toward me?

00:36:45.953 --> 00:36:47.893
[I can come in 20 minutes. Wait.]

00:36:47.893 --> 00:36:49.020
Is he flying here or something?

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.480
How could he get here in just 20 minutes?

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.480
You don't have to rush.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.120
If you rush for no reason...

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.040
Okay.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.600
Want something to eat?

00:37:04.426 --> 00:37:06.320
Hey, is Ahn Ye Rim ghosting us again?

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.380
No use talking.

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:09.700
Guess she doesn't vibe with us anymore.

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:11.280
After all, she did something
during the middle school days.

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.600
Now she's pretending to be nice.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.620
Hey, check this out.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:17.100
Ahn Ye Rim's being ridiculous.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.900
So this is the lifelong-single guy
she said was cute?

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.780
Ah, such a tease.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.026
They're just close colleagues, right?

00:37:24.026 --> 00:37:27.560
If the blind date hadn't been canceled,
it would've been a disaster.

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.781
Now she's clearly telling us to back off.

00:37:29.781 --> 00:37:31.840
Hey, even if she told me to date him, I wouldn't.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.946
He's kind of a weirdo.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.340
What's this advice about?

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:38.973
Just tell me quickly.

00:37:38.973 --> 00:37:45.480
Eun Gi suggested doing a proper
personal shoot instead of fittings.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.180
What do you want to do?

00:37:49.173 --> 00:37:51.680
I can't decide.

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:54.900
If you want to try, gaining experience is good.

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:56.680
Just don't get carried away.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.540
What if you get too excited and end up confused?

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.680
I heard your grades are good.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.266
Then you should focus on getting into college.

00:38:04.266 --> 00:38:06.640
Okay. Thanks, Gi Jeong.

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.840
We are done, right? Bye.

00:38:12.352 --> 00:38:14.586
Could you come with me...

00:38:17.786 --> 00:38:20.293
at least to the shoot?

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:25.453
Why should I?

00:38:25.453 --> 00:38:28.466
- Well, it's just...
- Hey, Ahn Ye Rim.

00:38:28.466 --> 00:38:30.370
Listen carefully one last time.

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:35.240
From now on, if you see me as a man, we're done.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.970
Got it?

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:41.960
Then why did you save me back then?

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.140
This is all because of you.

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:47.160
- If it weren't for you...
- Then you'd have kept living as a troublemaker.

00:38:48.693 --> 00:38:51.946
No. I don't do that anymore.

00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:57.110
Yeah?

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.660
If you're gonna fake being nice, commit to it.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.600
Don't make me regret helping a bully unknowingly.

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:12.890
So you hate me for that?

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:15.630
Because I was a bully?

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:17.030
No.

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:18.650
I just do.

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.940
Hey, what was Ye Rim talking about earlier?

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.849
- Are they dating?
- Ugh, no way.

00:39:32.849 --> 00:39:35.906
No, earlier she mentioned
taking responsibility or not.

00:39:35.906 --> 00:39:37.200
Exactly.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.540
Hey, hey, hey.

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:39.800
What's that about?

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:43.680
She was probably talking about the first time
Gi Jeong and Ye Rim met back in the day.

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.866
Huh?

00:39:44.866 --> 00:39:47.180
She's more skilled than I thought.

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:24.210
Ah, seriously.

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:25.930
She's too cute.

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:28.430
I'm the one who's supposed to be cooler.

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:33.050
Ah, don't touch me.

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:34.930
You're still cute, you know.

00:40:35.866 --> 00:40:37.670
What are you doing?

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:54.573
- What?
- Your hair.

00:40:54.573 --> 00:40:55.710
Just like this.

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:57.840
What? Darn it.

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:02.391
I rushed over.

00:41:02.391 --> 00:41:04.310
Exactly.

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:05.770
How'd you get here in 20 minutes?

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:07.720
You said 'yes' too, right?

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:10.730
I just answered it that way.

00:41:15.266 --> 00:41:17.890
Is your jaw okay?

00:41:21.249 --> 00:41:24.650
Oh, it hurts.

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:26.586
Why's your punch so strong?

00:41:26.586 --> 00:41:27.830
Are you a guy?

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:29.613
Because I was pissed off.

00:41:29.613 --> 00:41:30.630
Why do you keep teasing me?

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:32.490
I told you I meant it.

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:34.331
Why can't you believe me?

00:41:34.331 --> 00:41:37.150
You asked me to marry you.
Would you believe it if you were me?

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:39.570
Sorry about that.

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:45.040
Then let's just pretend that never happened.
What would I have to say for you to believe me?

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:46.570
What do you keep asking me to believe?

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:49.110
That I like you.

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:50.270
What do you mean?

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:54.130
If I said I like you and asked you out,

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:56.270
you'd hate it, right?

00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:57.690
Hey, I know everything.

00:41:57.690 --> 00:42:00.493
Hey, it's a joke. Seriously.

00:42:00.493 --> 00:42:03.000
Hey, I know too.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.066
I shouldn't come on to you like that
when you're not ready.

00:42:07.066 --> 00:42:08.690
What's there to be ready for?

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:09.730
That'll never happen.

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:11.890
Then why'd you ask to meet today?

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.870
Why do you keep joking around?

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:18.650
We've already talked about that. Done?

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:20.250
No.

00:42:21.693 --> 00:42:25.830
Why did you say I was pretty?

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:27.130
Was that a joke too?

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:28.690
I said it because you're pretty.

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:29.930
Why?

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:31.070
Don't lie.

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:34.920
Why do you keep treating me like a joke?

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.650
What's pretty about me?

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:41.390
Everything.

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:43.010
Everything's pretty.

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:44.708
See?

00:42:44.708 --> 00:42:45.710
Why?

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:47.030
What's wrong?

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:48.970
Can't everything be pretty?

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:50.150
Stop it.

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:51.990
That's basically the same
as saying I'm not pretty at all.

00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:53.130
So it's all lies.

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:54.550
Where's the logic in that?

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:56.550
You lack sincerity.

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:58.590
Sincerity?

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:00.190
What's that?

00:43:01.186 --> 00:43:03.250
Sincerity... You don't know?

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:05.510
I don't know.

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:07.750
Then if I point it out clearly,
would you believe me?

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:09.350
Huh?

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:12.270
See?

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:15.150
If everything's pretty,
how can I pick one? Darn it.

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:17.106
See? You can't even say it.

00:43:17.106 --> 00:43:19.250
Wait, wait, hold on.

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:23.530
Earlobes.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:25.710
Everything's pretty,
but especially your earlobes are pretty.

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:27.551
- What?
- Your earlobes are really pretty.

00:43:27.551 --> 00:43:28.710
Huh?

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:30.770
You have a mole here, huh?

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:34.790
Ding-dong. Ding-dong.

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:39.170
Hey.

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:40.170
Why're you so red?

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:41.630
Running a fever?

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:43.230
Hey.

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:46.010
What should I do?

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.840
Ah, this is so embarrassing.

00:44:04.026 --> 00:44:05.770
Are you okay?

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:07.370
Yeah.

00:44:08.293 --> 00:44:09.710
Why'd your temperature spike suddenly?

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:11.430
Is it sudden flu-like symptoms?

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:14.350
- Shouldn't you take medicine?
- I'm fine now.

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:16.110
I'll leave now. Bye.

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:18.050
Hey.

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:19.990
We haven't even started talking.
Where are you going?

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:21.590
Huh?

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:27.360
Back here again?

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.480
Talk fast.

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:29.680
What is it?

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.380
So,

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.053
I won't ask to date right away.

00:44:34.053 --> 00:44:36.720
- Huh?
- Instead, let's be friends.

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.066
What?

00:44:38.066 --> 00:44:41.746
You don't really know me, right?

00:44:41.746 --> 00:44:45.320
How awesome I am.

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:48.680
Well, actually, how decent I am, you know.

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:50.200
I want you to have time to get to know me.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.260
What's that supposed to mean?

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.340
So until now, if we weren't friends...

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:59.360
We haven't done enough
to really call ourselves friends.

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.653
But it's too comfortable to say we're not.

00:45:01.653 --> 00:45:03.720
It's an awkward spot, right?

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:07.466
Then let's officially
declare our friendship this time

00:45:09.106 --> 00:45:11.333
and do a 'Doweon-gyeori' thing.

00:45:11.333 --> 00:45:13.440
That doesn't sound quite right.

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:16.660
No. It's 'Doweon-gyeori'.

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:19.440
Hey, why are you Googling that?

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:21.120
It's 'Blood Brotherhood Oath'.

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:23.680
Not 'gyeori' but 'Blood Brotherhood Oath'.

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.280
Whatever!

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:27.440
Okay.

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.660
My friend request.

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:30.580
You'll accept it, right?

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:32.820
Why are you making a friend request
sound like a duel challenge?

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:34.653
You'll accept it, right?

00:45:38.306 --> 00:45:40.670
Leave now.

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:42.270
Just a little further.

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:45.770
What kind of friend takes me home?

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:47.650
Hey.

00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:50.290
Friends can take you home too.

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:52.390
Anyway, go.

00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:55.010
It'll be awkward if we meet my mom like last time.

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:56.610
But we're friends now?

00:45:57.773 --> 00:45:59.640
Anyway, go.

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:02.110
Got it.

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:05.370
But,

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:08.853
let's not do this friend thing
like someone else and drag it out.

00:46:08.853 --> 00:46:09.870
Huh?

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:12.906
From what I've seen, that never ends well.

00:46:12.906 --> 00:46:16.520
Let's keep things fast and clean.

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.350
You know where this week's gathering is, right?

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:19.350
Should we meet up and go together?

00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:21.030
No.

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:24.410
See you on Sunday.

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:26.010
I'll go.

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:28.830
Nam Gi Jeong.

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:30.590
Huh?

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:32.946
Don't you have an inferiority complex
or something?

00:46:32.946 --> 00:46:34.570
Inferiority complex?

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:35.790
What's that?

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:37.390
Is that some new pencil lead brand?

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:43.010
See you on Sunday! My female friend!

00:46:45.186 --> 00:46:48.600
'Quick and decisive', you dummy.

00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:10.230
Go.

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:12.550
I don't want to say anything to you.

00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:16.770
I said go.

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:19.710
You drama queen.

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:26.910
How decent I am, you know.
I want you to have time to get to know me.

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.910
Hey Song U Yeon, your earlobes are really pretty.

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:32.290
Ding-dong, ding-dong.

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:34.050
Oh, jeez.

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:37.950
Why does he go around touching
other people's earlobes like that?

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:51.040
You have a mole here, huh?

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:54.240
Ding-dong, ding-dong.

00:48:07.386 --> 00:48:10.520
Wow, they look awesome.

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:29.893
What are you doing? Not coming? Let's go.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.380
Make some noise
when walking behind me from now on.

00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:35.360
Oh, okay.

00:48:37.373 --> 00:48:39.360
Suits you well.

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.640
They said it's around here.

00:48:51.106 --> 00:48:52.880
I guess it must be over there.

00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:00.853
Huh? Baeblu, you came?

00:49:00.853 --> 00:49:01.910
Oh.

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:03.570
Have you arrived?

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:05.830
Wow, everyone looks so different.

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:08.850
You two look perfect together.

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:11.890
This is most unjust.

00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:15.090
If I had only won at rock-paper-scissors,
I'd have become king.

00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:16.640
Goodness, how daring.

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:20.310
Depose the Ping Empress immediately
and execute three generations!

00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:21.450
What did you say?

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:23.310
- Warrior Kahyul!
- Warrior Kahyul!

00:49:23.310 --> 00:49:27.110
Run at once to my father and tell him
to take measures to depose the king!

00:49:27.110 --> 00:49:28.750
As you command, Your Highness!

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:31.190
Wait, weren't you supposed to be my bodyguard?

00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:36.266
I, your humble servant,
shall take up this sword, Your Majesty!

00:49:36.266 --> 00:49:37.350
Ugh.

00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:38.350
You two-faced rat!

00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:40.830
- Drag him away and execute him!
- Execute him!

00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:42.667
Show mercy, Your Majesty.

00:49:42.667 --> 00:49:46.530
All three names are already in the death registry.
Don't struggle pointlessly.

00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:49.150
You'll all just take turns dying anyway.

00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:52.600
You look amazing!

00:49:56.013 --> 00:49:57.586
Where's Blue Finger?

00:49:57.586 --> 00:49:58.770
Blue Finger?

00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:00.750
Oh, there he is.

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.040
As expected, he's awesome.

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:26.518
Blue Finger.

00:50:29.706 --> 00:50:31.640
You dung beetle.

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:36.190
Behold. I am Nam Gi Jeong!

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:42.760
Wow, she's totally out of it.

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.260
Ah, this is making it way too easy.

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:46.606
- Have you come?
- Move aside.

00:50:46.606 --> 00:50:47.610
Huh?

00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:49.340
Get out of the way.

00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:57.460
He's classy.

00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:01.400
You came?

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.840
Hey.

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:09.840
Hurry up and change.

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:11.510
Hey, you're the only one
who didn't change clothes.

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:14.440
- Wait.
- Ugh, seriously.

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:16.200
Hey, get over here quick.

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.880
Hold on.

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:19.480
Just once.

00:51:24.493 --> 00:51:26.840
Pretty. It suits you.

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:28.660
What, you've never seen someone pretty before?

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:32.540
Hey, Miss Piggy.

00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:34.140
Come out already.

00:51:40.626 --> 00:51:44.110
No, this is kinda complicated.

00:51:51.946 --> 00:51:53.130
Why?

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:54.990
Does it look weird?

00:51:56.070 --> 00:51:57.670
Yeah.

00:51:58.290 --> 00:51:59.890
Super weird.

00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:03.070
I'm an idiot for even asking you.

00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:18.230
Cute.

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:38.920
Hey.

00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:40.850
What're you doing there?

00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:44.070
Huh?

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:45.670
What are you doing?

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:52.270
Come now. Let's go together.

00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:53.870
Wait, my friend.

00:53:01.850 --> 00:53:03.546
Give it. It's not heavy.

00:53:03.546 --> 00:53:05.786
I know.

00:53:05.786 --> 00:53:09.290
Does Gi Jeong like Baeblu?

00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:10.430
Yeah.

00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:12.030
To the point of lovesickness.

00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:16.266
Should I have been that obvious too?

00:53:16.266 --> 00:53:18.290
Would it have been easier then?

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.328
Let's go.

00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:26.710
Hey, Green Pig.

00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:28.490
What?

00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:33.010
The one who Baeblu likes isn't Khaki.

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:36.430
Then who is it?

00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:39.910
Your guy friend, Seon Ho.

00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:42.470
What are you doing?

00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:43.470
Not going?

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:45.630
I'll go.

00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:47.610
Alright, everyone,

00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:52.550
welcome to the Spirit Fingers
spring outdoor croquis session!

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:56.550
So, shall we start with a 1-minute sketch,
starting with Baeblu?

00:53:57.186 --> 00:53:58.790
Sure.

00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:00.390
Alright, let's get started.

00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:05.480
Right.

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:10.080
Come to think of it, we did
outdoor croquis when we first met too.

00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:14.773
Couldn't have imagined this back then.

00:54:14.773 --> 00:54:17.660
Why the grin, Lord Baeblu?

00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:23.700
I'm confident in my poses now, you see.

00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:36.826
Your posture is truly uninhibited, my lord.

00:54:36.826 --> 00:54:39.740
What's your concept?

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:44.586
The concept is a carefree nobleman.

00:54:44.586 --> 00:54:46.700
You're too adorable.

00:54:57.310 --> 00:55:00.510
Come here, Lord Red.

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:05.170
I, I'll go.

00:55:07.146 --> 00:55:10.240
Hey! Snap out of it! You clueless fool!

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:12.110
Get in.

00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:13.893
Why?

00:55:13.893 --> 00:55:15.640
Fix it.

00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:21.110
She has gotten quite bold, our Baeblu.

00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:22.710
Tell me about it.

00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:30.405
I am Mint, a court eunuch.

00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:40.570
Am I visible to you?

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:42.170
Let's go together.

00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:49.770
Wow, your drawing skills are improving so much.

00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:52.150
You drew this particularly well.

00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:57.550
Oh, I'm full.

00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:06.370
Okay, everyone.

00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:09.910
How about 30 minutes of free time to digest a bit?

00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:10.910
Okay.

00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:12.870
- Go ahead.
- No, let's all go.

00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:14.680
All together.

00:56:17.350 --> 00:56:19.533
Out, out, out.

00:56:29.570 --> 00:56:31.690
I'll come too.

00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:34.290
What?

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:36.750
Don't you owe me an apology?

00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:38.350
For what?

00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:47.773
- You touched mine back then.
- Huh?

00:56:52.386 --> 00:56:54.860
What nonsense is this?

00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:59.173
Are you pretending not to know? You pretended
to fall while hiding and touched my chest!

00:56:59.173 --> 00:57:02.280
That was an accident.

00:57:06.386 --> 00:57:08.386
It was my first time.

00:57:08.386 --> 00:57:10.260
My purity.

00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:16.260
Jeez.

00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:19.760
I can't believe I got excited by that person.

00:57:21.333 --> 00:57:22.460
Fine.

00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:24.160
Sorry, I apologize.

00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:28.760
Just words?

00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:30.360
Then what?

00:57:33.333 --> 00:57:37.586
Then let me touch you a bit too,
and we'll call it even.

00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:45.770
You pervert.

00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:48.030
Do you want to die?

00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:49.030
Hey, why?

00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:51.810
What goes around, comes around.

00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:52.810
Hey.

00:57:52.810 --> 00:57:54.910
Hey, you, stay there!

00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:56.890
Hey!

00:57:56.890 --> 00:58:00.030
- Are you dating me? Why keep following me?
- I'll kill you.

00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:01.790
Ah, darn it.

00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:05.090
I made space for that punk,
but he's just acting like a kid without a care.

00:58:05.090 --> 00:58:06.493
This won't do. I should go...

00:58:06.493 --> 00:58:08.131
Don't move.

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:13.400
Just stay like that for 15 seconds.

00:58:18.586 --> 00:58:19.620
Done.

00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:21.640
Go now.

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:24.120
Hey, I'll leave even if you don't tell me to.

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.520
Hey.

00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:28.520
Wait.

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:32.066
Stop throwing a tantrum for no reason.
You'll get hurt.

00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:07.398
- I'm going to wipe you out of my head entirely!
- Wipe what?

00:59:07.398 --> 00:59:08.450
Let go.

00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:10.630
If you knew that, why did you
tear it up and waste money?

00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:11.950
We were clueless today.

00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:13.430
- Enjoy your date.
- Bye!

00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:14.930
Let me sleep, you punk!

00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:16.250
I took off my wig.

00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:17.250
This is my real hair.

00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:18.950
You took off your hat,
but why do you look the same?

00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:21.110
I've been attending drawing club
every Sunday lately.

00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:23.430
That jerk. Darn punk.

00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:24.430
Are you insane?

00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:26.510
I'll pick you up when exams end.

00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:29.790
If walking around together
after exams isn't a date, then what is?

00:59:29.790 --> 00:59:32.650
If you step in instead, I won't refuse.

00:59:32.650 --> 00:59:34.770
Should I go talk to Seon Ho?

00:59:34.770 --> 00:59:36.370
That I like him?

00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:41.750
Darn it, I'm late for class!

00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:42.870
Koo Seon Ho!

00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:44.893
Koo Seon Ho isn't here, right?

00:59:44.893 --> 00:59:47.880
Darn it! Oh, sorry.

00:59:52.370 --> 00:59:55.430
Today was tough.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.060
Since we worked hard, let's eat something good.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.120
You've gotten so skinny from avoiding me.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.240
Let's go eat.
