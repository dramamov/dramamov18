00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.610
(Episode 89)

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.150
Are you left-handed?

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:15.450
Why do you ask?

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:16.820
Is there a problem?

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.160
No, not at all.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.890
Itâ€™s just that I am, too.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm a lefty, too.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.130
I usually use my right hand,

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.000
but this one's the star of the show.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.540
Looks like we have something in common.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.540
What's the big deal?
There are tons of lefties out there.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.450
Don't try to use this as an excuse
to get friendly.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.480
I don't care what happens
between you and my sister.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.180
How cute.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.390
You're so annoying!

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.620
I'm leaving!

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.030
Where have you been?

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.150
What's the deal with that Lawyer Kim?

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:18.950
What about him?

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.990
He dragged me out to eat for no reason.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.760
- You two met?
- I told him no, but he insisted.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.590
He came on way too strong,
trying to be all friendly.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.530
He was just trying to get along.
You could at least humor him.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.470
We'll talk later.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.970
I heard you took Se Ri out.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.580
Yes. We need to get close
as soon as possible.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.610
I don't see her as a sister-in-law.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.510
She's more like a daughter to me.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.150
She got upset and left earlier,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.320
so I wanted to go over tonight
and smooth things over.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.950
You're coming over again?

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.820
You were there just a few days ago.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.190
It's practically my home now.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.590
As a matter of fact,
I've always wanted a daughter her age.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.760
Honestly, I wish she were my daughter.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.730
Even if Se Ri turned out
to be your secret daughter,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.170
I'd be totally okay with that.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.210
I didn't realize you'd go that far.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.510
Thank you for saying that.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.810
I went to the last place...

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.380
Chairman Min was spotted
on a traffic camera with Madam Jang.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.820
Were you able to deduce
their final destination?

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.490
No. The location is a little strange.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.230
The car definitely entered that road,
but we lost it after that.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.400
Kim Sun Jae would've anticipated
this move,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.770
and he could've had them switch cars
somewhere along the way.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.200
Or he could've used the rush hour traffic
on a congested road...

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.210
to slip down a side road
no one would think to check.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.540
If they have an accomplice,

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.280
it would make things much easier for them.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.550
I'll keep looking into it,

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.050
but as of now, unless Min Kyung Chae
and Kim Sun Jae start talking,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.750
I don't think it will be easy
to find Chairman Min Doo Sik.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.960
If I can't find him in a month,
I'll be forced to resign.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.760
I don't think they'll even give you
a full month.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.570
Once those two get engaged this weekend,
they'll be running the show.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.830
What's to stop them?

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.240
They'll probably cook up
some other scheme...

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.900
to replace you as CEO...

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.740
and then get rid of me, too.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.610
I can't let them push me out like this.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.440
I haven't accomplished anything yet.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.510
Let's go back there together later.
You never know.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.820
We might find that side road you missed.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.790
All right, let's head out after work.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.330
You're home late.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.400
I had to take care of something.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.400
Why? Did the chairman call or something?

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.570
No, it's not that. You have a visitor.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.800
A visitor?

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.340
It's me, Mother.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.510
You look like you've been busy.
You seem tired.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.310
I had an off-site meeting.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.850
So that's why you look so exhausted.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.190
Would you like a piggyback
from your son-in-law?

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.090
Shall I carry you to your bedroom?

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.460
Hop on.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.090
That's enough.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.630
Get me a glass of water, please.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.230
Yes, ma'am.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.080
If the engagement party is this weekend,
when is the wedding?

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.790
We don't have a firm date yet.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.860
It's too much to plan for that
with Father gone.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.160
Haven't you been coming over a lot lately?

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.930
I know you guys are getting engaged,
but still.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.330
It's because of my youngest sister-in-law.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.930
I saw her for a bit earlier,
and I already miss her.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.240
Your sister-in-law?

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.610
That rolls right off your tongue.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.510
Too bad for you.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.910
Se Ri really can't stand you, you know.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.050
Just look at her now.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.550
She's sulking in her room,
refusing dinner.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.890
She'll come around eventually.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.120
Manager Gong.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.360
Allow me.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.630
I've got to score some points
with my future mother-in-law.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.570
See? The guy's got no shame.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.940
"Mother-in-law" just rolls off his tongue.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.180
Here you go, Mother.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.020
You won't accept.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.760
Hearing me call you that
makes you cringe, doesn't it?

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.890
The feeling's mutual.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.500
Like you said, it's not like
our relationship was casual.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.070
We lived together and even had a kid.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:04.570
For us to become
mother-in-law and son-in-law...

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.000
is pretty messed up, right?

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.970
I'm glad you realize that.
That's why I told you to call it off.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.910
But after seeing Se Ri today,

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.880
I know I absolutely must
have this wedding.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.050
For some reason,
she doesn't feel like a stranger to me.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.080
I wonder if it's because
she's Min Kyung Chae's daughter.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.550
She's the reason your daughter is dead.
And you're saying what?

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.060
- She "doesn't feel like a stranger?"
- Look who's talking.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.060
You're doting on your daughter's killer,
acting the perfect stepmom.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.660
When you hold her in your arms,
don't you think about your own daughter?

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.200
When you look her in the eye
and talk to her,

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.870
or when she smiles and calls you "Mom,"

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.870
don't you think of your dead daughter?

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.710
I was never a real father to her, but you?

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.880
You said she meant more to you than life.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.680
You're putting on an act and playing mom
to Min Kyung Chae's daughter.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.820
How is that any different from me
putting on an act to be her dad?

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.090
So don't you dare tell me
to call this wedding off.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.230
I already told you.
If you don't want to be my mother-in-law,

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.900
then you're the one
who can pack up and leave.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.830
Are you finished?

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.770
What if I am? What are you going to do?

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.370
I, for one, am getting a mother-in-law
I never expected,

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.640
and I couldn't be happier.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.710
Is that right?

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.240
Fine. Let's see this through to the end.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.780
I'm thrilled to have
an unwanted son-in-law.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.750
But you'd better play your part
as a son-in-law properly.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.220
Because I'm
a very demanding mother-in-law.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.720
Before that, why not show me some love,
Mother?

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.160
Next time I come,
at least serve a whole hen for me.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.860
I'll be looking forward to it.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:38.900
Why, you...

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:40.770
Darn...

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:43.940
Darn it...

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.220
Director Moon,
you're really something else.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.890
How can you be
in the same position for so long...

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:06.390
without a single promotion?

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.190
What's wrong with being a director?

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.960
And what about you, Lawyer Kim?
It's not like your career took off either.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.930
For me, being head of the legal team
was as high as I could go from the bottom.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.640
But now that I'm about to
become a member of the owner family,

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.210
I suppose I can get directly involved
in management.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.710
Oh, right.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.940
Speaking of company policy...

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.880
The rule that only gives control
to the owner family,

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.820
don't you think
that's an incredibly outdated policy?

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.150
That's a long-standing tradition
here at Mingang.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.190
Other firms hire management specialists...

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.090
to run things more transparently,

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.590
but here at Mingang Distribution,

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.590
it seems we're keeping...

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:46.100
an autocratic system
of hereditary management.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.970
If you can't stand the heat,
get out of the kitchen.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.740
If you hate Mingang so much,
find another company.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.070
That's not my point.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.570
I'm saying the owner family
monopolizing control is unreasonable...

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.080
Then become part of the owner's family.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.280
If you weren't born into it,
then work your way up like I did.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:03.810
With your engagement party so soon,

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.580
you act like you're on top of the world.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.750
I guess the chairman's absence...

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.390
is the last thing on your mind now.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.290
Don't touch this.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.090
The chairman really liked these flowers.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.760
Don't tell me you've already forgotten
your promise.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.830
I keep my promises.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.700
If my father isn't back within a month,
then that vase...

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.810
and you will be gone before me.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.680
I've put up with you this long.
I can wait a little longer.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.940
Such patience is nice.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.780
Right.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.520
The engagement party is tomorrow.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.380
Should I wear traditional Korean clothing?

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:15.620
After all, as the mother of the bride,

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.620
I should at least show
that much courtesy, right?

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.790
Wear traditional Korean clothing
or a bikini.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.200
Do whatever you want. I won't stop you.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.670
However, I'm not sure...

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.800
how long you'll get to play that
"mother of the bride" act.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.090
(Mingang Distribution)

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:56.490
Is there anything useful?

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.030
No.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.560
It's all related to the engagement party.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.230
There's nothing about
Chairman Min Doo Sik.

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.500
If we don't find him within a month,
we're in big trouble.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.470
Don't worry. We'll be sure to find him.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.840
You haven't heard from
anyone else, have you?

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:14.950
Heard from anyone?

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.250
While we're desperately searching for him,

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.080
I'm sure Chairman Min is trying to escape.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.150
He must be trying anything he can.

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:23.520
He might find a way to reach out.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.970
Is he asleep or what?

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.110
Yes, Lawyer Kim.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.120
There's no need to ask.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.780
He eats what we give him,

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.650
sleeps soundly, and is doing just fine.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.420
The Serno Hotel this weekend?

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.860
Congratulations on your engagement.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:06.030
So you're finally tying the knot
with CEO Min.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.170
What trouble could that old geezer
possibly cause?

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.540
Don't you worry.
We're watching him closely.

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:14.970
Right.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:16.870
Yes, sir. I understand.

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.220
They lock me up in here...

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.060
and will do what behind my back?

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.160
Who gave them permission?

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:36.960
I ought to wring their necks!

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.040
(Serno Hotel)

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:51.480
(Congratulations on the Engagement,
Min Kyung Chae and Kim Sun Jae)

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.480
Kim Sun Jae.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:00.620
Sun Jae.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.720
Kim Sun Jae!

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:06.660
Today's the day. Finally.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.490
I've worked my whole life for this day.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.230
Engagement, then marriage,
all in one shot.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.730
Half of Mingang Distribution...

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:20.940
is now in the palm of my hand.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.920
Gosh, my stomach!

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.820
My stomach! I'm dying!

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.660
I think my appendix burst!

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.260
My stomach!

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:46.060
Help! Somebody, help me! Goodness.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.070
Hey, what are you doing?
Are you just going to let me die?

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.940
- My stomach!
- Darn it.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.640
What's wrong? Where does it hurt?

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.270
Help me! Somebody, help!

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.910
Hey, what if his appendix
really did burst?

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:58.940
Darn it.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.780
- He needs an ambulance for surgery.
- I'm dying!

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:03.710
He could actually die
if we don't do something.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.080
Hurry up and call an ambulance!

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.750
- Unbelievable.
- My stomach!

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.360
I'm dying!

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.030
My stomach...

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.430
I'm dying! My stomach!

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:21.670
My stomach...

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:24.270
My stomach...

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:26.870
Where is that ambulance?

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.310
It should be here any minute.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:29.710
Right.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:32.480
Isn't Lawyer Kim's engagement
at the Serno Hotel?

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.610
It's probably happening as we speak.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.850
But still, how did him pull off
an engagement so quickly?

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.450
He's really something else.
I'm telling you.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.230
Hey, stop right there! Quick, get him!

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.460
Darn it!

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.700
(Congratulations on the Engagement,
Min Kyung Chae and Kim Sun Jae)

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.760
Thank you to all our distinguished guests
for joining us on this momentous occasion.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.990
This event is not only to celebrate...

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.690
the engagement of Min Kyung Chae and me,

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.360
but also a commitment to the prosperity
of Mingang Distribution...

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.500
My apologies.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.070
- What is it?
- Sir, we have a problem.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.480
That old geezer, Min Doo Sik,
he just escaped.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:40.740
What?

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:47.150
Got it.

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:48.890
My apologies.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.490
Something very important came up.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.730
(Congratulations on the Engagement,
Min Kyung Chae and Kim Sun Jae)

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.600
What do you mean?
How could Min Doo Sik have escaped?

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.200
He faked being sick to trick us,

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.270
and then vanished in the blink of an eye.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:09.510
You incompetent fools!

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:11.240
Find him now!

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.910
Tie him up or gag him. I don't care how!
Just find him!

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.580
What if he shows up at the party
and makes a scene?

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:19.320
I think he might know where it is.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.720
How would that old man find his way here?

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.990
I think he may have overheard us talking.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.160
Darn it. Then you need to find him
even faster!

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.890
If you fail to catch him,
it's your necks on the line. Got it?

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.960
Darn it.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.340
What's going on?

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.040
Nothing at all.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:43.810
Why did you come out here?

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.480
Let's go back inside.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.690
Come to the chairman's office
at Mingang Distribution for the fare.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.960
I'll pay ten times,
no, a hundred times over.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.800
There's no way
he'd actually show up here, right?

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:15.070
I wish my father could have been here
to see this.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.180
This is such a happy occasion,

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.740
but with my father being absent,

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.010
I can't feel completely joyful,
which is a pity.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:30.590
I feel the same way.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:33.960
She is an exceptionally devoted daughter,

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.060
and her love for her father is profound.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:39.660
So I completely understand her wish
for the chairman to be here with us.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.270
As do I.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:43.570
Give me a break.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:45.740
All right!

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.940
If everyone would please
raise their glasses...

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.310
to bless the two of us
as we begin our life together,

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:52.940
and though he cannot be here,

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.610
let's also make a toast to the chairman.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.520
What a pathetic show.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.330
You're praying for my safe return?

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.960
You kidnapped and imprisoned me!

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:12.830
And what do you do next?

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.500
Get engaged?

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.470
So this is your plan to take over Mingang?

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.440
You cursed fools!

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.480
You two are perfect for each other.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.180
A pair of cockroaches.
That's what you are.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.150
You're soulmates!

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.080
Then you deserve an engagement gift!

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.350
You scum!

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.690
You're not even human!

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:37.220
You're the scum of the earth!

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.660
Be gone, you evil spirits!

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.560
Be gone, you evil spirits!

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.630
Chairman, it's not what you think.
We had no other choice...

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:45.400
Father, please calm down.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.100
Please, just listen to what I have to say.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.430
Listen to what! Here, take this!

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:51.640
Darn it.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:55.570
You're all the same!

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.740
Your own father went missing,
and none of you bothered to look for me?

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.310
You're all just brown-nosing
to take over the company.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.750
Pathetic! Just pathetic!

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.080
You despicable fools!

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.220
You worthless scoundrels!

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.430
What are you doing?

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.210
Now, let us all raise a toast.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.110
To the two of us,
as we take our first step toward...

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.340
becoming husband and wife,

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.580
and to the chairman, who isn't here
but will surely return soon.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.080
Cheers!

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.390
(Congratulations on the Engagement,
Min Kyung Chae and Kim Sun Jae)

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:52.760
Let go of me, you brats!
Didn't you hear me?

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.370
Lucia!

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.600
- Lucia!
- Quiet.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.070
Hey, don't do this.

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:10.010
What's wrong?

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.550
I don't know. I thought I heard something.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.030
Sun Jae was on cloud nine, right?

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.860
He was smiling from ear to ear.
He couldn't have been happier.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.230
And he didn't mention me?

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.630
I'm his only blood relative, you know.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.140
He didn't look for me?

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.410
When has Sun Jae ever reached out to you?

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:36.810
What do you expect?

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:39.710
Sun Jae? You can't get blood from a stone.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:41.750
Actually, a needle probably couldn't
even pierce his skin.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.950
Why would he care about
his aunt and uncle?

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.450
He wouldn't even invite his own parents.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.950
That's just too much.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.850
I may be his uneducated aunt,
but I'm still his mother's sister.

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:53.360
How can he just blow me off
completely like this?

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.230
Please, calm down.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:58.230
He already acts
like he's a gift to the world,

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:59.630
and now he'll be unstoppable.

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:01.230
He'll be totally insufferable.

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.670
Is that what you're worried about now?

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:06.270
What if Sun Jae doesn't invite us
to the wedding either?

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.110
What's the big deal? It's simple.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:09.610
If we're not invited, we don't go.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.510
We won't have to bless his wedding
with our money.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.180
I'm sure he'll invite you to the wedding.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.050
Forget it! I'm disgusted, I wouldn't go!

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:18.150
I won't attend even if he sends
a limo to pick me up.

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:21.750
Anyway, that guy's one sharp cookie.

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.150
While his future father-in-law is away,
he just weasels his way in like this...

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.860
and snatches up the son-in-law spot
at Mingang Distribution like nothing.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.230
Is being Mingang's son-in-law no big deal?

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:32.900
They look so good together.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.600
A picture-perfect couple.

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:38.770
Lawyer Kim may have rushed
this engagement through,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.500
but I wouldn't bet on a wedding.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.340
It's not over until they're at the altar.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.710
And knowing Min Kyung Chae,

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:47.140
she's not going to
just meekly accept Kim Sun Jae.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.510
That's right. It'll be a struggle for them
to make it to the altar.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.780
What's with you two?

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.620
Are you trying to comfort me?

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:56.390
You don't have to do that.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:59.220
My Ho Se and Min Kyung Chae broke up.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.390
It just means they weren't meant to be.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.400
I don't have any hard feelings,
so you two can stop.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.630
It's just, on a day like today,
I thought you'd be thinking of your son.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.430
Of course I am.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:14.470
Sometimes I think, if I had known Ho Se
was going to die like that,

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.810
I wish he'd at least left a child behind
who looked just like him.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.020
I was so desperate,
I even considered that girl Se Ri...

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.720
to be my Ho Se's daughter.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.450
That thought actually crossed my mind.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.330
I think you've had enough.
You're quite drunk.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:45.470
How is it for you, Lawyer Kim?

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.210
We're engaged now.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.710
Do you feel any different
than how you did before?

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.880
For me? No, nothing's different.

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.980
You should head inside.
I'll see you to your door.

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.250
You're such a loyal retainer.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.120
Very reassuring.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.680
We're engaged,
but you won't let me kiss you?

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.420
Do you dislike me that much?

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:38.320
Do you love me?

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.230
Don't worry.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.730
I'm a woman of my word.

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:48.900
At least you don't have any drama
with other women.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.970
No cohabitation, no kids out of wedlock...

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:53.300
You don't have that kind of past, right?

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:56.870
That's the one thing I can't forgive.

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.040
I'm so sick of it because of my father.

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.450
As long as your record is clean
in that department,

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:05.450
I'll have no reason
to break off this engagement.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:18.360
She's the one who had a live-in boyfriend
and a child out of wedlock,

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.400
but I'm not allowed to?

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:23.630
All right, fine.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.440
If that's what Min Kyung Chae wants,

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.340
I'll play along.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.150
Look, I'm just asking you to let me go up
to the chairman's office.

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:39.920
I told you that the chairman
wasn't in right now.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:43.190
Then who was the person
who hitched a ride in my car that day?

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.890
I'm telling you,
he clearly said he was the chairman.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.430
You can't just enter
the chairman's office.

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:50.430
Please leave.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.230
If you keep this up,
I'll have to call the police.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.600
What? If anyone should be calling
the police, it's me!

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:57.470
What's going on here?

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:01.500
This man keeps insisting
he gave the chairman a ride...

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.610
and that he needs to collect the fare.

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.140
The chairman?
Which chairman are you referring to?

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.180
He said he was the chairman
of Mingang Distribution...

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:11.350
and asked me to take him
to the Serno Hotel.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.180
He said something about...

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.480
his daughter's engagement party
being there.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.150
By any chance, could I see
the dashcam footage from that day?

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:27.760
It's him.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:29.630
So he was there that day.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:34.040
No wonder. I heard a noise
outside the banquet hall that day.

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:36.640
I can't believe we missed him.

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:41.680
If he were caught again,
they'd likely move him somewhere else.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.810
That makes sense.
Since he's already escaped once,

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.750
they'll definitely take extra precautions.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.720
Sir.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:58.530
From now on, I'm not Lawyer Kim.
I'm your son-in-law.

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:01.100
And a member of
Mingang Distribution's owner family.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.270
You think I'll accept you
as my son-in-law?

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:05.400
In your dreams.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.870
Your approval means nothing to me.

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:11.810
I'm part of the owner family now,
and I'll be the new head of Mingang.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.440
How I decide to grow this company
is the only thing that matters.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:15.780
You think I'll actually let you...

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.880
and that wench Kyung Chae
get away with this?

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:21.250
- As soon as I get out of here...
- Still dreaming about that, are you?

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:23.450
You got lucky and escaped once,
is that it?

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:26.090
That's never going to happen again.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.790
We're moving you.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.130
To a place
where no one will ever find you.

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.760
That's useless. Do what you want.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.030
Lucia will come to save me soon.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.530
- Soon, Lucia will...
- Who?

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:39.200
Lucia?

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:44.710
You have got to be kidding me.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.480
Do you even have a clue
who Lucia really is?

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.250
Let me tell you about Lucia.

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:53.780
She's not who you think she is!

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:05.330
What is all this?

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.970
Now that the engagement party is over,

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:11.030
I'm finally cleaning out
this storage room.

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.640
I have something to throw out too.
One second.

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:32.160
This is from back then...

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:35.630
This is my older sister.

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.360
If you ever see someone...

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:43.230
who looks like her,

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:46.240
will you please give me a call?

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.780
But why does she look so familiar?

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.210
No matter how I look at her,
she reminds me of someone.

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:56.410
(Searching for a missing person)

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.680
Don't tell me, Madam Jung?

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.560
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:31.110
I'll get straight to the point.
Let me meet your sister.

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:32.520
Where are you right now?

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.420
Manager Gong took the flyer to the office!

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:36.450
Hello?

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:38.460
Isn't this
Director Moon Tae Kyung's phone?

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.390
That voice sounds so familiar.

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:42.630
It's over for you, Baek Sul Hee.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:46.430
Then I guess I'll just have to make
Min Se Ri end up like my Mi So.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:48.570
You plan to hold Min Se Ri hostage?

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.270
Her real name is Baek Sul Hee?

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:51.770
That's right, it's her.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:53.370
Now I remember.

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.740
