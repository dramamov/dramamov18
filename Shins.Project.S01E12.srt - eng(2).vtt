(Ttoli Super)

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.820
So, you're Ye On's boyfriend?

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.490
How'd you know?

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.930
The keychain.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.530
It's a matching set, isn't it?

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.200
You must be the guy Ye On mentioned.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.770
I got this for our "Two Two" anniversary.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.110
- Two Two? - Our 22nd day together.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.910
What? You didn't do this for Si On?

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.250
Dude, celebrating anniversaries is just basic.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.580
Two Two, our 50-day,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.120
and I spent two dollars on our 100-day anniversary.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.750
I get it.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.050
So what?

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.930
- What are you trying to win? - What's in it for me if I tell you?

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.230
- What? - We have to negotiate.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.530
It's a little give-and-take.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.830
That's what a negotiation is.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.340
Fine.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.110
What do you want?

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.440
A double date.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.980
You pay for it,

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.610
and I'll make the plans.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.710
Deal.

I don't normally tell anyone this, but I'm only telling you.

Pull it taut. No, her face is all squished.

Okay, loosen it up.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.030
That's it.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.560
How's that?

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.130
Good. Tie it up. Yes, tie that side too.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.200
- Tie it up. - Okay.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.670
The photo looks great.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.400
- Congratulations, Si On. - Thank you.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.070
- You did great. - It came out nice.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.440
Looks great, doesn't it?

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.080
What is this? And what's with that picture?

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.080
Who said you could do this? This is so embarrassing.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.580
Chil Bong, I told you this photo was too much.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.020
That's what I'm saying. I even cited Penal Code Article 307,

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.560
and even explained Article 750 of the Civil Code.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.990
You all said you liked it, and now you're backing out?

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.930
Who said we didn't like it?

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.030
Not when she passed with flying colours like this.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.870
That's what I meant, too.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.340
- So you were all in on it. - Right?

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.110
When I'm a cop, I'm going to arrest every last one of you.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.380
- A cop? - Hey, Si On, you want to be a cop?

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.150
Hey, Cho Philip, didn't you go to the Police University?

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.020
- So you'd be my junior? - Don't get ahead of yourself.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.520
I'm so proud of you, Lee Si On.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.320

- Hey, when did you get here? - I just got here.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.000
Well, everyone, Jang Tong Woo's back from fighting with his girlfriend.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.900
- Unbelievable. - Where have you been?

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.240
- Sorry I'm a little late. - Not at all.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.300
Did you two make up?

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.210
Keep your voice down. Now everyone will know we fought.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.880
He hasn't made up with her yet!

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.110
Look at this.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:24.820

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.120
Congratulations.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.160
What's all this?

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.790
We've got expensive Chinese dishes.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.400
What's going on with you? Did you put your shop up for sale?

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.030
You called us all here. I'm nervous. What is this, the last supper?

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.740
To think, yesterday I was still on the fence about this.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Everyone,

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.170
I'm getting married.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.180
- Let me see. - Here. Please make sure you come.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.480
- Congratulations. - Congrats. I'll be there for sure.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.750
- Congratulations, Mr. Jang. - Thank you.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.020
So you're really going through with it?

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.150
You know the saying about weddings. Nothing's final till you say 'I do'.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.320
There you go again with your nonsense.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.990
I'm just worried, that's all. He wasn't eating for days on end.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.400
- And now suddenly a wedding... - Come on. That's enough.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.270
To be honest,

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.740
I just don't understand how a woman's mind works.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.610
One minute, she's not mad anymore, and the next, I'm not so sure.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.280
It's just a few days away.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.580
If you've set the date, then it's a done deal.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.180
Speaking of which,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.620
I'd like you to officiate for me.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.050
What?

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.450
An officiant?

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.020
Mr. Shin.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.060
A widower as an officiant? Don't be ridiculous.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.870
Besides, don't you know having no officiant is trendy now?

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.230
Is that right?

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.100
- Then Pillip, you can be the MC. - What? Me?

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.510
- Yes. - That's a great idea.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.910
The MC's always the handsome friend.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.050
Wait, no.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.720
What I mean is, he's the best-looking one here.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.190
Did you have to pick from just us?

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.660
But since I'm from Andong,

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.290
not having one feels a little...

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:21.730
What's with that look?

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.100
It's kind of scary.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.240
Here, take this.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:27.670
What is this?

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.640
Congratulations on passing your exam.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.780
Buy yourself something nice to wear to the wedding.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.010
I have plenty of clothes. Mr. Shin already bought me a lot.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.420
That's different.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.780
This is for your wedding attire.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.220
My wedding attire?

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.590
It's a family gift for the wedding.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.460
To me, you're like my little sister.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.000
Come on.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
I guess I really am part of the Hujin Arcade family.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.440
You didn't know? We all think of you as family.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.500
I know.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.910
What's wrong with it? I think it's pretty.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.250
Go change, Si On. That's not it.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.060
Perfect, Si On. You look like Her Majesty the Queen.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.660
- How much is this? - It's around 2,000 dollars.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.030
No.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.540
Isn't it a little revealing right here?

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.470
- Look, Mr. Shin. - What?

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.810
I think I liked the last one better.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.020
Fine, just pick whichever one you want.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.550
This is perfect for a wedding. The other ones were little...

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.620
This is the most appropriate, right?

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.160
Si On, I should've gotten the strawberry.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.760
I want some ice cream too. It's not fair you two eat without me.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.970
- Then go get some yourself. - I'll be right back.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.330
All right, see you in a bit.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.590
- I'll have this one. - Okay.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.500
Is it true you hired Yun Dong Hee to commit a contract killing?

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.170
- Why order Cha So Yeon's murder? - Did you really gaslight him?

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:40.340
I treated my patient, and didn't gaslight him.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.840
Based only on the words of a patient with a severe mental illness,

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.680
framing me as a criminal is a criminal act itself.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.810
- I will fully cooperate. - Stand back!

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.820
- Do you admit to the charges? - Please give us a statement!

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.980
Please just say something!

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:54.720
(With the People! For a Hopeful Future!)

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:58.260
Since police filed no charges, the case is as good as over.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.330
If Yun Dong Hee appeals, it could go to prosecution,

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.100
but he has his own hands full, so I doubt he can do it.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:11.640
With me at the police station, you've been busy, Pillip. I'm sorry.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.300
Mr. Shin.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.310
Detective Choi.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.310
- You've been through a lot. - Not at all.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.950
I owe it all to you, Detective Choi. Thank you so much.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.020
You two haven't eaten, have you? Let's go.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.660
There's a delicious tofu place right in front of the station.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.160
Tofu?

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.290
Sounds good. Time for a fresh start, Mr. Shin.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.230
You little punk, shut it.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:40.860
Let's go.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:42.400
Let's go. Yes.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.440
Hello.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.340
Nice tie.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.250
- You made it. - Yes, I'm here.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:56.810
- Hey! - Please, go on up.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.050
- Hello. - Hi.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.790
- Hey, you made it. - Let's go!

(Groom: Jang Tong Woo Bride: Song Yeon Ji)

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.440
Wow, this is why I love traditional weddings.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.250
They did a nice job with the photos here.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:34.990
Hey, is that really Mr. Jang?

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.090
They really overdid it with the Photoshop.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.290
It doesn't even look like Mr. Jang.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.490
Right? It doesn't look like him, does it?

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.130
You've really made it, Mr. Jang.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.400
With a bride this beautiful,

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.770
what's a little heartache?

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.170
That guy is a real piece of work.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.640
Not too long ago, he was out for his blood.

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:58.210
I can't help it. I'm getting emotional.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.240
You should've been this nice when he was still around.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.820
So you're saying it's not happening?

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.050
Yes. My dad won't approve.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.290
What's so wrong with a fifty-fifty marriage?

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:11.760
You know my dad.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.960
He insists the man has to be the one to buy the house.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:19.900
Who even thinks like that these days?

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:21.730
Listen.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:23.970
Look at me.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.600
When I said I'd cancel the wedding, what did you tell me?

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:32.110
You said you'd convince your father before the wedding, right?

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:36.910
I got my parents to approve. What are you going to do now?

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.820
Let's just have the ceremony, and I swear...

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.020
I'll definitely convince my dad. Okay?

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.660
How can I possibly trust you now?

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.860
A man who lied to me right up until our wedding day.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:54.730
Look, I'm about to lose my temper. Can you leave? I might hit you.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:55.930
Yeon Ji!

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.270
Unbelievable...

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.640
Mr. Jang.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.410
- You're here. - Your wedding photos are great.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.950
Hey, are you sick? Why the long face?

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:17.450
Why the long face?

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.390
Yeon Ji says she can't marry me.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.090
Why? Did she fall out of love with you?

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:25.630
It's not that.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.630
What Yeon Ji wants is a fifty-fifty marriage.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.700
A fifty-fifty marriage? What's that?

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:35.270
- Half the time together? - Seriously...

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.940
It's when a couple splits expenses fifty-fifty.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.610
That's pretty popular these days. I like it. No burden on either side.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.580
Then what's the problem? You guys can just do that.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.380
My father is the problem.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.550
And Yeon Ji's parents are just as adamant.

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.090
For goodness' sake.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.590
Looks like you'll have to step in.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.700
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:07.300
Whoever gives more naturally expects more in return.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.710
It doesn't matter who's who.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.150
We're just saying let's be fair. What's the problem with that?

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.550
He's 100 percent right about that.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.750
A daughter-in-law who's so blunt about what's right...

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.060
I'm just worried she'll get on her in-laws' bad side.

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:32.600
See? This is exactly why I want to split it all fifty-fifty.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.200
My mom and dad only have me.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.230
And you're an only son.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.240
Tong Woo.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.110
I want to treat both sets of parents equally.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:53.950
I want to split costs to be an equal partner in our life.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:56.320
- Right, Mom? - Of course! Absolutely!

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:58.520
- Right, Dad? - Yes. You bet. Of course.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.090
Why won't your father let us?

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:03.890
- Dad! - Knock it off!

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.600
Come on, just let the kids do what they want.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.730
Why are you always taking his side?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.570
When a new bride joins the family, the groom's side provides the house.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.440
That's our family's way, isn't it?

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.240
That's how you've lived your life in comfort, like a queen!

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:25.680
Comfortable? I was sick with worry. I don't care about the tradition.

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.790
Do you want our son to die a lonely old bachelor?

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.020
What are you on about now? Always muttering and scheming!

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:34.220
- Dad! - Attention!

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.730
I offer to buy you a house, and you still make a fuss.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:40.160
And it's not just about our family tradition.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.730
We need to pay so that, as a man, you can hold your head high.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:48.640
- Look at the state of you. - What's wrong with the state of me?

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.310
You're acting like the houseboy. Here, go ahead and sweep.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.280
Hello, sir. Hello, ma'am.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:01.150
Yes, my name is Mr. Shin. I run the chicken shop by Jang's.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.520
Yes. A pleasure to meet you.

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:06.560
It's clear how much you both love your son.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.660
- What parents don't? - Exactly.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:16.700
But the bride's family is saying they don't need any gifts or money.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.500
What I'm getting at is...

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:23.770
I hear her family observes ancestral rites nine times a year,

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.610
and since Tong Woo is such a great cook,

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:31.380
he could make the savoury pancakes and the soup for every ceremony,

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.450
and on holidays, he could even make some braised short ribs.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.160
If he does all that, his in-laws will absolutely adore him,

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.530
and he could hold his head high. What do you think, sir?

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:47.060
What are you talking about? Why should our son serve their dead?

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.430
I'm about to stop doing it for our own ancestors!

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.440
So why are you spouting such ridiculous nonsense?

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.870
I offer to give them the house and still...

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.810
Just give it to them.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:06.080
Just skip the parents, and give it to the grandchild directly.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.350
A grandchild that doesn't exist yet? That could take ages!

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.160
Oh, my gosh! Is she pregnant?

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:13.460
For real?!

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.690
- What? For real?! - My boy!

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.530
- Easy there, ma'am. - Dad, it's always been Yeon Ji.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.070
- Well done, son! - Is it a boy? A boy?

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:26.270
- It's a boy. - How can you ask that right now?

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.510
- He's quick, just like his dad. - We should go.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.740
- I got it in one shot! - Thank you.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.450
(Agreement: Tong Woo and Yeon Ji Home and Wedding: Pay Evenly)

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.520
(Parental allowances: equal. 5: Events: equal. 6: Chores: fair)

00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:59.840
I think you're clear to begin your address, sir.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.270
- Understood. I'll keep it brief. - Yes, brief is good.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:05.080
- Right. - Is that Chancellor Kim Kyung Soo?

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.080
- Who's that? - Could it really be...

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:11.850
he's the officiant?

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.490
- Sir, if you'll just step this way. - Yes.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:19.720
Tong Woo, that punk.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.830
Let me introduce the groom and bride!

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:23.830
She's so pretty.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:29.430
Article one. Our house cost will be split fifty to fifty.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.700
Article two. Wedding costs will be split evenly.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:38.270
Article three. For one holiday, we'll see the groom's family first,

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.910
and the bride's family first for the other.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:46.080
Article four. We'll give parents equal allowance.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.550
Article five. We'll treat family events equally.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.920
Article six.

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:56.230
House chores will be divided fairly by mutual agreement.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.000
The groom, Jang Tong Woo,

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.670
- The bride, Song Yeon Ji. - We...

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.600
are now getting married.

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.310
As they say, "Man proposes, God disposes,"

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.640
and from that, a harmonious home will prosper.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.610
So love each other, always and forever.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.950
Next up, we'll have a speech from the groom's father.

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.890
Let's give him a warm round of applause, everyone.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.930
Hello...

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:38.600
Is this thing on?

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:43.410
Yes, I am the father of the groom, Jang Tong Woo.

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:48.110
I had a speech prepared, Instead, I'll address their agreement...

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:52.220
my son and his bride prepared. I'll give that instead of my speech.

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:56.290
First, I offered them a house, but since they refused,

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:59.190
we'll do it their way and split it evenly.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.590
I'll give my half to my grandchild who will be born next year.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.930
It's all about splitting things fifty-fifty these days.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.240
And for the holidays, you don't need to see us twice a year.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.540
Just come once, and take a pass on the other!

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.240
I'll skip the rest.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:18.780
Oh, happy day!

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.250
- Dad, smile. - I am smiling.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.690
One, two, three.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:35.260
Everyone looks so happy.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.860
Hey, Si On, does this make you want to get married?

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.300
Someday...

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:45.340
I guess I will.

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:49.440
No matter which punk you marry,

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.670
you can't do it without my blessing.

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:52.810
Of course.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.940
You're the one who's going to walk me down the aisle.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.260
Friends and family, please come forward.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.760
Let's go get our picture taken. Come on, let's go, Si On, come on.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:09.830
Let's go.

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:17.670
Thanks.

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:22.240
- Hope you'll be happy. - Thanks.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:30.280
Congratulations.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:37.450
(Ji In)

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:40.260
Hello?

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.360
Congratulations.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.910
I was planning to tell you after the college entrance exams.

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:04.250
But that banner really made me angry.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:05.550
What?

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.880
I...

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.490
I really want to be a cop.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.220
Really?

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.860
Then how about the Police University?

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.460
I'll tutor you. I was 1st in class at the academy.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.630
There you go again, showing off.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.070
This place was pretty during the day,

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:31.210
but it's beautiful at night, too.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.640
Yes.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:35.110
The moon is beautiful, too.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:41.550
You're more beautiful.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:47.090
Whatever...

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.160
Yes, I know.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.600
I have something for you.

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:15.790
What do you give it to me?

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.650
Who else would I give it to?

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:19.990
There's no one but you.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:27.930
Why?

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.100
Don't you like it?

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.400
It's beautiful.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.350
(Courthouse)

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.650
The number of civil cases filed in court in 2023 was...

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:59.060
over 4.57 million, and the number continues to rise.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:01.020
And I'm sure everyone here knows that, right?

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.890
On average, a civil lawsuit costs thousands to tens of thousands.

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:07.530
And the first trial takes an average of one year.

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:10.530
For ordinary people, that's an agonizing amount of time and money.

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:13.840
But does going to trial even guarantee a clean resolution?

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.810
Is the law truly fair to everyone?

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.780
Do you really believe that's what justice is?

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.880
I, for one, do not.

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.310
The wealthy can afford to hire expensive lawyers,

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.620
while those without often go unrepresented.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:31.920
Too often, the verdict is decided by who has more money.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:36.560
The law shouldn't be a weapon for the rich and powerful, right?

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:42.030
This is why I decided to create the Conflict Resolution Task Force.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.600
But isn't that what the Mediation Committee is for?

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.740
The current system makes proactive mediation very difficult.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:50.070
We're all experts at reviewing documents, aren't we?

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:51.410
But let's be honest.

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:55.080
How can people like us, stuck behind our desks,

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.580
truly understand the hardships...

00:24:57.850 --> 00:24:58.920
that ordinary people face every day?

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:00.750
Mediation is a great idea, sure.

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.150
But is it realistically feasible?

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.960
The Shin's Project. For 18 months, I've funded this...

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:12.530
from my own pocket, and through it, we've mediated over 20 cases.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:16.570
All of them were settled amicably without ever going to trial.

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:20.970
Cases range from neighbourly disputes to corporate lawsuits.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:23.310
They included suits against local government.

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:27.580
Best of all, it saved a lot of time and even more money.

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:29.580
The court provides legal support,

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.680
while communication and mediation are handled by a field expert.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.080
What kind of expert?

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.920
Mr. Shin of the Shin's Project.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.920
And who is he exactly?

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:43.860
Shin Jay.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.100
He's a former FBI and Interpol crisis negotiation advisor,

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:52.100
He's a negotiation expert who was the youngest to teach at Harvard.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:57.410
Recruited by our Foreign Ministry, he has handled disputes...

00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:59.080
of all sizes and negotiations between nations.

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.580
You mean someone so accomplished is leading this Task Force?

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:04.350
I'm telling you, he's been doing it this whole time.

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.480
Of course, he handled some of them alone,

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:09.820
but he also worked on several cases...

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:11.920
together with one of our judges, Cho Pillip.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.990
So the two of them are leading the Task Force?

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:17.760
That's the plan for now.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.160
So this is that task force you were talking about?

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:24.730
I knew something was fishy when you brought Pillip in.

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:27.870
Using my name without permission and stirring up all this trouble.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.140
What, you think I'm doing this for my own benefit?

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:32.380
So you're doing it for my sake then?

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.380
You do what you do best, and so does Judge Cho.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:39.350
- You two work so well together. - Oh, come on. No.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.480
Find someone better than me.

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.650
To me, you're the best person for the job.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.390
Oh, really? Why? Because I'm easy to boss around?

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:50.230
Wait, wait. I just thought of someone better.

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.230
He has a great give-and-take dynamic with Pillip.

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.830
This job is perfect for him.

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:57.170
Who?

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:01.340
You got them all?

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:04.040
- 100 percent? - See for yourself.

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:05.470
No way.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.720
What is this?

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:15.250
You really did it.

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:20.060
I can't believe it. It was so hard to convince Ms. Jeong.

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.860
Yes, she was a tough one.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.030
I had to wash her blankets...

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:27.760
and spent an hour sorting her recycling.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.470
- Thank you! - Wow!

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:37.110
Hey, Pillip.

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:39.510
Wow, I'm impressed.

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:44.510
Of course. Our motto is "Give and Take."

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:55.990
(Give and Take by Kim Su Dong)

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.930
I already know how skilled Kim Su Dong is.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.630
Does he still hack The Blue House these days?

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:04.900
Making a public official do your dirty work.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.540
I told you, I didn't make him do it.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.040
This country is so corrupt, he was just curious about it.

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:12.440
And he says he just took a little peek.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:17.180
But the timing is suspicious. Why are so many scandals popping up?

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:18.580
He just looked. That's it.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.020
He is doing nothing illegal. He's been clean for a long time.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.550
All right, tell everyone to come on down.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:25.290
- Count me out. - Why?

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:28.220
- I have somewhere to be. - Where?

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:29.290
America.

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:31.730
To see Ji In?

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.660
A week should be enough then, right?

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:36.930
I'll be with her for a long while.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.770
Okay. Two weeks.

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.270
Tell you what, I'll give you two weeks.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.140
Tell Ji In I said hello.

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:45.540
This guy, I swear.

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:49.310
You're such a pain. Seriously. .

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.120
Stop laughing.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.090
(Temporarily Closed)

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.990
You really didn't have to come all this way.

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:06.300
Please give this to Ji In. It's just a little something.

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:08.860
I just wanted to show her I care.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.430
Ji In also...

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:14.600
wanted me to tell you she's grateful you care for Jun.

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:19.040
- Have a safe trip. - I will. Thank you.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:25.380
Hey, why did you all come out too? It's not like I'm leaving for good.

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.820
Mr. Shin, you have to come back soon.

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:29.620
If you're gone too long, we'll lose our regulars.

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:33.660
- Especially since I'm leaving too. - Worry about yourself, not me.

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.590
Once you're at that task force thing,

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.400
you'll see how Judge Kim Sang Geun is.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.130
Then you'll get a taste of it yourself.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.300
I'll be back, Si On.

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:45.630
- Take care. - Okay.

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:47.100
I'll be back, everyone.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.100
You take good care of the shop.

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:52.510
- You have your passport, right? - Hey, of course. Come on.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:53.880
I'm off.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:55.510
Hey, Si On. All right.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:59.220
You can head in now, Madam Joo.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.980
(Let's smile more today than we did yesterday)

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:05.250
(Conflict Resolution Task Force)

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.360
So this was your grand plan all along.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:10.760
What do you think?

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:13.330
It's great.

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:17.230
To be honest, I learned a lot working with Mr. Shin.

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.800
That even the smallest cases are never simple.

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.710
- I've got my work cut out for me. - Okay, good.

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:26.080
And you?

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:30.310
Looking at this, I'll have my hands full.

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:31.850
With a workload like this,

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:35.620
I should get overtime and hazard pay for this, right?

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.450
This is the Court. If I don't get you paid, I'm fired.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.090
All right then.

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:43.630
Deal!

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:46.460
Okay, so you two are in.

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:48.830
For now, let's eat. This is good. So good.

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:50.770
It's delicious, right?

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:52.500
This is good.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:54.300
I know.

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.770
(One Month Later)

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:58.210
Cho Pillip!

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:00.110
How have you been?

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:01.410
You've been well?

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:03.180
I've been well.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:06.780
(Conflict Mediation TF, Project S)

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.080
Judge Cho, about that...

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:10.150
what happened with that lawsuit?

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:12.760
Which one? There are so many lawsuits.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.260
The lawsuit about not feeling "soul-refreshing"...

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.160
You mean Jung Kyung Uk?

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:20.960
Yes. He sued again. Said he wasn't happy after one bite.

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.470
If you ask me, the guy's not in his right mind.

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:27.240
He's obviously harassing the defendant.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.100
Do we really have to settle this?

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:31.240
Shouldn't we just take it to court and hit him with a hefty fine,

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:34.380
Whether we hit him with a fine or make him pay court costs,

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:35.980
Following the law is the easy part.

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:37.650
What you should be asking yourself is,

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:39.680
why he keeps doing this.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.520
If we check up on Jung Kyung Uk, I'm sure something will pop up.

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:46.920
Forget a background check. Do a "foreground" check.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.960
The two of you, go meet him and ask him directly.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.230
I'm going to see Judge Choi.

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:53.100
I ran into him earlier,

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:55.300
and he said he absolutely will not join.

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:56.830
And you're proud of that?

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:59.370
What did you say to make him refuse so strongly?

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.600
I told him it was rewarding work.

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:07.910
You should've told him it's the path to a great future.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:11.210
A future for the Republic of Korea, a future for his career.

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:15.150
You're so inflexible. What did Mr. Shin teach you?

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:20.660
That guy has a weird way of putting things.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.360
Why bring up Mr. Shin? Unbelievable.

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:26.460
Mr. Kwon, you're going too far.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:29.530
You're the one who's going way, way too far, ma'am.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.600
What do you mean the cleaning bill is 250 dollars?

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.140
I've been your customer for ten years.

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:35.600
How can you charge this much?

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:36.840
Why doesn't it make sense?

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:40.510
Five dress shirts for 15 dollars, five coats for 75 dollars,

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.010
and 160 for the mink. It adds up.

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:45.050
I even threw in the scarves for free.

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:46.480
160 Dollars for a mink coat?

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:47.750
Look, Mr. Kwon.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.090
- Since when do you charge for mink? - I decided to start this year.

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:55.860
For ten years, I cleaned your minks, ironed your shirts, and for what?

00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:00.500
You threaten to kick me out, and you're always raising my rent.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.800
You should have some shame. Why do you always rip me off?

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:05.630
Are you done, Mr. Kwon?

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.070
Who do you think you have to thank for your business here?

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.940
I get by on my own skills, so what?

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:14.510
I won the grand prize...

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.310
at the National Dry Cleaning Competition twice!

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:19.980
Look at him, getting all bug-eyed.

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.480
Mr. Kwon, are you crazy?

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.220
Honey, I'm at the dry cleaner's in the arcade.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.130
Tell them to kick this shop out immediately.

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:32.530
The nerve of that tenant!

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:36.000
I'm only gone for a month...

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:39.440
and the whole neighbourhood has turned into a war zone.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.640
Hey, Mister, who are you?

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:52.710
Me?

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:57.390
I'm just the small business owner who pays rent to fry chicken here.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.920
Why do you ask?

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.660
Mr. Shin!

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:06.100
Look at all the riff-raff sticking together.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.430
We get along just fine, so you don't need to worry about us.

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:12.330
But listen, ma'am.

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:13.670
This man here...

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:17.110
Do you have any idea who you're messing with?

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:18.340
What's that supposed to mean?

00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:23.110
Ma'am, you've picked the wrong guy. Your husband is trying to impress...

00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:25.380
City Councilman Kwon Bong Geun, right?

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:30.090
He and this man, Kwon Chil Bong, are blood brothers.

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:31.290
The Kwon Family!

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:33.160
That's ridiculous.

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.260
Don't lie.

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:40.460
Go ahead and check for yourself. Who are you to pull a power trip?

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:42.830
- What? A power trip? - Who's on a power trip?

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:45.070
Pillip!

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:52.610
She wants her mink coat cleaned free and threatens to have me kicked out.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.750
That statement falls under Criminal Act 283, Intimidation,

00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:59.550
punishable by up to 3 years' prison or a fine of up to 5,000 dollars.

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:03.150
Also, it appears you are obstructing his business in front of the store,

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.460
which is Criminal Act Art. 314, Obstruction of Business,

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.120
punishable by up to 5 years in jail or a fine of up to 15000 dollars.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:10.660
Shall I continue?

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.500
What, are you all ganging up...

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.870
on one defenceless woman?

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:18.800
I'm not going to stand for this!

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:20.440
You'll pay for this!

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:26.780
- Tell Mr. Kim to come himself! - Unbelievable.

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:28.740
Mr. Shin.

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:30.480
I've missed you.

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:35.380
This neighbourhood falls apart the second I'm gone.

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:37.720
Mr. Shin. I missed you too.

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:40.260
Come here. I missed you too.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:44.760
Hey, Pillip, aren't you getting in on this?

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:52.630
Alright, hold on. It's been a while, so it's my treat.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.600
Let's go grab some chicken. How about it?

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:56.510
- Yes, okay! - Let's go.

00:35:56.808 --> 00:35:58.648
That outfit isn't your daily outfit,

00:35:58.648 --> 00:36:00.418
nor Officer Kim's.

00:36:01.148 --> 00:36:02.318
What's the look you're going for?

00:36:03.218 --> 00:36:04.888
These days, I'm just...

00:36:05.488 --> 00:36:06.518
Kim Su Dong.

00:36:07.088 --> 00:36:10.058
Man, once my online and real-life personas merged,

00:36:10.328 --> 00:36:11.658
it's so liberating.

00:36:12.328 --> 00:36:15.398
Hey, you're one to talk, Mr. Shin. What's with this whole getup?

00:36:15.798 --> 00:36:17.668
I know, right? What's with that hat?

00:36:19.268 --> 00:36:21.668
I have a friend named Manuel, in California,

00:36:21.738 --> 00:36:25.738
who runs a big Mexican restaurant.

00:36:25.808 --> 00:36:29.578
Business was going so well he opened some branches in Mexico.

00:36:30.408 --> 00:36:33.648
But you know how it is, things don't always go as planned.

00:36:35.318 --> 00:36:40.218
He wanted to sell the business. I brokered a deal with a rich local.

00:36:40.318 --> 00:36:44.988
The deal went through smoothly, so he gave me this as a gift.

00:36:45.998 --> 00:36:47.598
But after all that incredible work,

00:36:47.858 --> 00:36:49.228
did you really only get a hat?

00:36:49.568 --> 00:36:53.468
Hey, what do you mean, "all I got"! A Mexican master artisan made this.

00:36:53.668 --> 00:36:57.908
He painstakingly made this by hand, stitch by stitch.

00:36:57.968 --> 00:36:59.508
Limited edition.

00:37:00.108 --> 00:37:01.908
Alright, so how much did it cost?

00:37:02.978 --> 00:37:04.078
45 bucks.

00:37:06.348 --> 00:37:09.248
- Come on. Seriously? - Hey, just listen.

00:37:09.518 --> 00:37:11.118
Anyway, what brings you two here?

00:37:12.558 --> 00:37:15.158
Mr. Shin, you need a little after-sales service.

00:37:15.688 --> 00:37:16.688
After-sales service?

00:37:16.958 --> 00:37:17.958
What kind of after-sales service?

00:37:18.028 --> 00:37:22.028
Remember Jung Kyung Uk, who sued us? Said it wasn't "soul-refreshing."

00:37:22.328 --> 00:37:23.328
Jung Kyung Uk?

00:37:24.168 --> 00:37:25.998
Right. That psycho?

00:37:26.568 --> 00:37:28.898
- Yes, but we settled that. - He's suing us again.

00:37:29.168 --> 00:37:30.768
- Again? - This time,

00:37:30.768 --> 00:37:34.108
he's suing since it didn't make him happy.

00:37:34.178 --> 00:37:35.178
What a lunatic.

00:37:35.238 --> 00:37:36.908
That absolute psycho.

00:37:36.978 --> 00:37:38.478
He's a serial suer.

00:37:39.048 --> 00:37:43.148
A guy like that needs a taste of real misery...

00:37:43.248 --> 00:37:46.018
to realise, "Wow, I actually had it good."

00:37:46.118 --> 00:37:50.428
- "That's the true taste of joy." - Right.

00:37:51.058 --> 00:37:52.728
- Mr. Shin. - Yes?

00:37:52.798 --> 00:37:54.798
- What should we do? - What?

00:37:54.858 --> 00:37:55.868
What should we do?

00:37:57.668 --> 00:37:59.168
What do you mean, "what should we do?"

00:38:00.198 --> 00:38:01.198
You two are...

00:38:01.598 --> 00:38:04.408
the so-called Task Force, right? You guys handle it.

00:38:05.038 --> 00:38:06.378
- What? - Hey!

00:38:06.438 --> 00:38:07.438
That's a low blow.

00:38:08.338 --> 00:38:10.948
Mamma mia, señorita.

00:38:12.378 --> 00:38:15.248
- Seriously. - Hasta la vista.

00:38:15.918 --> 00:38:18.888
Hasta la vista.

00:38:22.288 --> 00:38:23.858
Hasta la vista!

00:38:26.358 --> 00:38:27.358
And Ji In...

00:38:27.798 --> 00:38:28.858
is doing well?

00:38:31.228 --> 00:38:32.898
She's gotten so thin.

00:38:34.498 --> 00:38:37.668
It took me 15 years...

00:38:37.738 --> 00:38:39.008
to say I'm sorry to Ji In.

00:38:40.578 --> 00:38:42.078
When I think about it,

00:38:43.308 --> 00:38:45.108
I feel just awful about it.

00:38:46.848 --> 00:38:47.918
I'm glad you went.

00:38:48.348 --> 00:38:50.288
You did the right thing. Here, have a drink.

00:38:55.118 --> 00:38:57.228
So now, what's your plan?

00:38:57.528 --> 00:38:58.958
What do you think?

00:38:59.858 --> 00:39:02.628
The shop was closed for a month, but my landlord, Chairman Park...

00:39:03.168 --> 00:39:07.468
- still demanded rent. Unbelievable. - He did?

00:39:08.338 --> 00:39:12.108
Seriously. What's with that guy?

00:39:12.268 --> 00:39:13.338
Tell me about it.

00:39:13.678 --> 00:39:15.308
It's tough making a living.

00:39:16.048 --> 00:39:17.048
So,

00:39:17.678 --> 00:39:19.418
come work for the Task Force.

00:39:19.778 --> 00:39:21.378
I'll give you a 20 percent pay bump.

00:39:21.478 --> 00:39:26.288
20 Percent? How stingy. At least double it.

00:39:26.358 --> 00:39:27.488
Come on.

00:39:27.888 --> 00:39:29.458
You're a straight-up thief.

00:39:29.588 --> 00:39:33.958
It's called "Shin's Project," right? Well, I'm Mr. Shin.

00:39:34.028 --> 00:39:35.498
All right, fine.

00:39:36.668 --> 00:39:37.668
We'll see how you do.

00:39:39.738 --> 00:39:42.338
I'm sure Su Dong is crushing it, as always.

00:39:42.708 --> 00:39:45.878
- How's Pillip doing? - Yes,

00:39:46.538 --> 00:39:51.178
- he's actually really on the ball. - Well, who do you think taught him?

00:39:58.448 --> 00:39:59.988
This is hitting the spot.

00:40:11.698 --> 00:40:15.138
Hey, Judge Cho!

00:40:15.198 --> 00:40:16.868
Hey, turn up the volume.

00:40:20.508 --> 00:40:23.808
Lee Heo Jun, who gaslit an inmate into murdering a colleague,

00:40:23.878 --> 00:40:28.748
was sentenced to 17 years in prison in his first trial today...

00:40:28.818 --> 00:40:30.118
and was taken into custody.

00:40:30.548 --> 00:40:33.558
- The former director... - Sweet justice.

00:40:33.558 --> 00:40:35.458
He has denied all charges and will appeal immediately.

00:40:35.518 --> 00:40:37.588
Park Jae Hyung has the story.

00:40:37.728 --> 00:40:38.728
(Congrats on the promotion! To your future!)

00:40:38.788 --> 00:40:39.798
(From Gyeonggi Bukbu Detective Task Force)

00:40:39.858 --> 00:40:43.028
All right, all right. Next up, from Gyeonggi Bukbu Police Agency,

00:40:43.098 --> 00:40:45.798
Detective Task Force, Officer Choi Cheol.

00:40:50.368 --> 00:40:54.878
I grant a special one-rank promotion to Sergeant.

00:40:57.808 --> 00:40:59.548
Choi Cheol! Choi Cheol!

00:41:01.648 --> 00:41:04.148
Kang Yeo Gyeong, Park Jung Hwan, congratulations on your promotions.

00:41:04.218 --> 00:41:06.418
- Thank you. - Let's hear it for them!

00:41:08.258 --> 00:41:10.828
- Everyone's off today, right? - Yes!

00:41:10.888 --> 00:41:13.758
Let's drink our hearts out tonight. Come on!

00:41:13.928 --> 00:41:15.968
- Cheers! - Cheers!

00:41:16.468 --> 00:41:17.668
Congratulations.

00:41:18.198 --> 00:41:20.468
- Thank you. - You did great. Really great.

00:41:21.068 --> 00:41:22.868
But, if you want to get technical,

00:41:23.208 --> 00:41:26.108
Cheol is the one who deserves all the credit for this award.

00:41:26.238 --> 00:41:29.548
Come on, it wasn't me. Our Team Leader did all the work.

00:41:30.048 --> 00:41:32.148
- Team Leader, give us a song! - Me?

00:41:32.208 --> 00:41:33.778
- Yes, belt one out! - You really want me to sing?

00:41:35.988 --> 00:41:40.058
You're really something else. You made history by being disciplined,

00:41:40.118 --> 00:41:41.958
and then made history again by getting promoted for it.

00:41:42.788 --> 00:41:45.898
On our team, a new Sergeant and a Superintendent.

00:41:45.958 --> 00:41:47.858
Man, that's really something.

00:41:48.928 --> 00:41:51.928
What does it matter if I have three pips or four?

00:41:52.028 --> 00:41:53.938
A detective's job is to catch crooks, that's it.

00:41:54.238 --> 00:41:57.638
Detective Kang, let's go bust some fraudsters.

00:41:57.738 --> 00:41:58.738
What?

00:41:58.808 --> 00:42:01.978
All right, everyone. Congratulate our team leader tonight.

00:42:02.038 --> 00:42:05.048
- I'm off to catch some criminals. - Man, you're a real workhorse.

00:42:05.108 --> 00:42:06.118
We'll be on our way.

00:42:06.178 --> 00:42:07.218
- Raise your glasses. - Let's have a drink.

00:42:07.218 --> 00:42:09.018
- Cheers. - Thank you for your hard work.

00:42:11.118 --> 00:42:12.118
Enjoy!

00:42:12.858 --> 00:42:14.588
(Hujin Arcade, Chicken Center)

00:42:14.888 --> 00:42:17.458
- Your Honour, shall we begin? - Yes.

00:42:19.298 --> 00:42:24.068
Man, this guy really set me off. I haven't been this mad in ages.

00:42:24.928 --> 00:42:28.068
The number of lawsuits he's filed and then dropped...

00:42:28.138 --> 00:42:31.638
is over 30. And you know what's even crazier?

00:42:31.708 --> 00:42:36.048
All the settlement money combined isn't even five grand.

00:42:36.348 --> 00:42:38.678
He wasn't just doing this for pocket change.

00:42:38.748 --> 00:42:40.018
What else have you got?

00:42:40.078 --> 00:42:43.588
I'd love to dig into his bank accounts,

00:42:43.648 --> 00:42:48.258
and expose his personal information. My fingers are itching to do it.

00:42:48.318 --> 00:42:51.528
But I need a warrant for all that.

00:42:53.198 --> 00:42:55.328
Mr. Shin, hello.

00:42:57.368 --> 00:42:59.598
Congratulations on your promotion, Sergeant Choi.

00:42:59.668 --> 00:43:02.198
How did you know? Thank you.

00:43:03.368 --> 00:43:05.568
- Congratulations, Detective Kang. - Thank you.

00:43:05.638 --> 00:43:09.478
For my promotion, I'm buying. Can we get some chicken?

00:43:09.848 --> 00:43:12.008
All right. Go ahead and have a seat.

00:43:12.608 --> 00:43:13.618
I'm so sorry.

00:43:14.078 --> 00:43:17.118
The traffic was terrible, so I'm a little late. I'm sorry.

00:43:17.218 --> 00:43:19.418
Look who's here. The guy with the warrant.

00:43:20.658 --> 00:43:23.628
In Jung Kyung Uk's bank account, we found money from a law firm.

00:43:26.158 --> 00:43:28.628
So, he's a litigation broker.

00:43:28.758 --> 00:43:30.268
Jung Kyung Uk files a suit,

00:43:30.568 --> 00:43:33.938
the firm approaches the defendant and gets hired to represent them.

00:43:34.338 --> 00:43:35.938
All right, chicken's here.

00:43:36.368 --> 00:43:38.168
- Thank you. - Enjoy.

00:43:42.208 --> 00:43:43.478
Pace yourself.

00:43:45.048 --> 00:43:46.678
Hey, Mr. Shin!

00:43:47.618 --> 00:43:48.618
What?

00:43:48.678 --> 00:43:50.988
Why are you going to the kitchen? There are no other customers.

00:43:51.088 --> 00:43:53.658
Hey, don't be lonely by yourself. Come eat with us, okay?

00:43:53.718 --> 00:43:57.228
- Let go of me, man. - Hey, the chicken here is amazing.

00:43:57.558 --> 00:44:01.428
- Who do you think you're telling? - Come on, eat with us.

00:44:01.428 --> 00:44:02.898
Come on, sit down.

00:44:04.628 --> 00:44:07.568
Telling the owner of a chicken joint to eat his own chicken.

00:44:08.438 --> 00:44:11.468
(Chicken Center)

00:44:12.108 --> 00:44:13.478
Look at this. Just look.

00:44:13.738 --> 00:44:17.978
Every single one of these victims is a small business owner.

00:44:18.378 --> 00:44:20.778
Why? Because they're easy targets.

00:44:20.848 --> 00:44:23.788
So he nitpicks over the most ridiculous things.

00:44:24.448 --> 00:44:25.748
Hold on a second.

00:44:30.458 --> 00:44:32.728
Crispy to the soul.

00:44:33.058 --> 00:44:35.498
Our original fried chicken.

00:44:36.668 --> 00:44:38.268
Take one bite,

00:44:38.828 --> 00:44:41.898
and our sweet and spicy chicken brings pure joy.

00:44:43.808 --> 00:44:45.538
What do you think?

00:44:46.308 --> 00:44:48.808
If we use this as our ad, right?

00:44:49.338 --> 00:44:52.508
Don't you think that crazy punk will try to sue us?

00:44:53.818 --> 00:44:56.588
Are you saying you want to be the bait?

00:44:56.848 --> 00:44:59.318
We have to go big, right?

00:44:59.588 --> 00:45:01.858
It's "Shin's Project," after all.

00:45:23.548 --> 00:45:25.778
It's only once a week. Are you sure you'll be okay?

00:45:26.118 --> 00:45:27.678
You must feel cooped up in your cell.

00:45:29.048 --> 00:45:31.518
You should consider daily visits, sir.

00:45:32.218 --> 00:45:34.318
For now, it's bearable.

00:45:35.218 --> 00:45:36.628
The people here...

00:45:37.058 --> 00:45:38.328
treat me very well.

00:45:39.058 --> 00:45:40.058
I'm glad to hear that.

00:46:28.138 --> 00:46:31.148
Those inmates over there, where are they from?

00:46:31.448 --> 00:46:34.818
They're temporary from Seonhyang. It's under construction.

00:46:35.318 --> 00:46:36.748
They'll be sent back next week.

00:46:38.748 --> 00:46:39.758
Let's go.

00:47:03.508 --> 00:47:05.708
The presidential election is just around the corner.

00:47:06.378 --> 00:47:07.948
About a month ago, I think...

00:47:08.618 --> 00:47:11.548
on my way to an interrogation, I saw your son.

00:47:12.448 --> 00:47:14.558
He's the spitting image of his father.

00:47:16.228 --> 00:47:18.688
I'll be waiting for good news.

00:47:29.568 --> 00:47:31.138
Man, it's hot today.

00:47:34.478 --> 00:47:35.478
Guard.

00:47:38.508 --> 00:47:39.848
Would you like an IV drip?

00:47:40.948 --> 00:47:43.048
- I'm fine, Doctor. - Okay.

00:48:23.228 --> 00:48:24.358
Dong Hee.

00:48:25.388 --> 00:48:26.398
Teacher.

00:48:55.018 --> 00:48:56.018
Ready.

00:48:56.558 --> 00:48:57.558
Go!

00:49:05.328 --> 00:49:08.798
Hey, Si On. You shaved off half a second today.

00:49:10.208 --> 00:49:11.608
Now let's just shave off one more second.

00:49:11.708 --> 00:49:13.938
Man, getting into the Police University is intense.

00:49:14.008 --> 00:49:17.248
. Hey, you'll run her into the ground.

00:49:17.778 --> 00:49:21.348
Hey, Si On. If Police University is too hard,

00:49:21.418 --> 00:49:22.778
you can just do something else.

00:49:23.018 --> 00:49:25.718
Right. Instead of going there, just marry a guy who did.

00:49:27.518 --> 00:49:31.658
- You cheeky little punk. - What? What did I say?

00:49:32.158 --> 00:49:33.528
Hey, you two, stop it.

00:49:33.798 --> 00:49:35.658
Let's go get some ramen. I'm starving.

00:49:35.898 --> 00:49:39.098
Ramen? Sure. Let's eat first, then train.

00:49:41.268 --> 00:49:42.338
No way!

00:49:42.698 --> 00:49:45.638
Did he really sue you? Because it wasn't "soul-crispy"?

00:49:45.808 --> 00:49:47.478
I told you he would.

00:49:47.878 --> 00:49:50.878
Do you have any idea what he wrote in the complaint?

00:49:51.848 --> 00:49:55.078
He said the fried chicken made his soul soggy,

00:49:55.148 --> 00:49:58.618
and the seasoned chicken brought waves of misery crashing down.

00:49:58.688 --> 00:50:02.658
That's insane. Our chicken is crispy and delicious.

00:50:03.928 --> 00:50:05.128
- They don't know anything. - It's hot.

00:50:08.398 --> 00:50:09.398
Yes.

00:50:10.468 --> 00:50:11.468
Really?

00:50:11.998 --> 00:50:12.998
Understood.

00:50:13.638 --> 00:50:17.338
Mr. Shin, the law firm called. We'll meet Detective Choi and Officer Kim.

00:50:17.538 --> 00:50:18.608
Really?

00:50:18.968 --> 00:50:22.478
- We should get going! - Hey, let me finish eating.

00:50:22.538 --> 00:50:25.748
- Then hurry up and eat. - Hey, let him eat in peace.

00:50:27.578 --> 00:50:32.548
So this is why all the tourists come to the Han River for ramen.

00:50:33.588 --> 00:50:35.688
Sexy Food, you know that?

00:50:35.758 --> 00:50:37.788
- Sexy Food! - Sexy Food!

00:50:39.628 --> 00:50:42.128
Yes. Enjoy, everyone.

00:50:42.198 --> 00:50:43.728
- Sexy Food! - Sexy Food!

00:50:43.798 --> 00:50:45.168
Sexy Food!

00:50:45.228 --> 00:50:46.568
- Sexy Food! - Sexy Food!

00:51:03.037 --> 00:51:05.707
- Did you pack everything you need? - I'm not a baby.

00:51:05.777 --> 00:51:08.307
Could've fooled me. That's why I'm walking you there.

00:51:09.047 --> 00:51:11.747
Ye On! Hey, Si On.

00:51:11.817 --> 00:51:15.017
- Hey. - I'm going to go with Han.

00:51:15.117 --> 00:51:16.117
Okay.

00:51:18.487 --> 00:51:21.787
Nice necklace.

00:51:22.797 --> 00:51:26.167
Tell Pillip to make sure he keeps his promise.

00:51:26.797 --> 00:51:27.797
What promise?

00:51:27.867 --> 00:51:30.167
That's our little secret. Let's go, Ye On.

00:51:30.237 --> 00:51:31.437
I'm heading out.

00:51:38.307 --> 00:51:40.577
- Bye, you two. - Bye.

00:51:44.277 --> 00:51:47.547
What a beautiful day.

00:51:49.387 --> 00:51:51.517
Hey, Si On.

00:51:52.087 --> 00:51:53.127
Where's Ye On?

00:51:53.487 --> 00:51:56.327
- She's at school already? - Yes, and I'm starting deliveries.

00:51:56.757 --> 00:51:58.127
- Mr. Shin. - Yes?

00:51:58.127 --> 00:52:00.627
- Cho Pillip is driving me crazy. - Why? What's wrong?

00:52:00.997 --> 00:52:03.837
Did that punk... did he do something to you?

00:52:03.997 --> 00:52:07.267
No, we barely see each other weekly.

00:52:07.407 --> 00:52:09.307
But he said it might not even happen this week.

00:52:10.037 --> 00:52:13.047
Why is there so much work with that stupid task force?

00:52:13.107 --> 00:52:15.447
Oh my. To be young and in love. That sounds great.

00:52:16.147 --> 00:52:19.077
What's so great about it? I'm miserable waiting for him.

00:52:20.587 --> 00:52:22.757
- All right, take care. - Okay.

00:52:22.817 --> 00:52:23.987
- See you later. - See you.

00:52:24.057 --> 00:52:25.057
Yes.

00:52:27.557 --> 00:52:28.827
- Hello. - Hi.

00:52:28.887 --> 00:52:30.997
(Ttoli Super)

00:52:31.127 --> 00:52:33.827
- Hey, Joo In. Cleaning up? - Hey.

00:52:33.927 --> 00:52:34.997
Always working hard.

00:52:35.927 --> 00:52:37.667
- Off to the bathhouse? - Yes.

00:52:37.737 --> 00:52:39.097
- Hey, wait a second. - What?

00:52:39.097 --> 00:52:41.407
- Just wait right there. - What? Why?

00:52:43.507 --> 00:52:46.447
Oh, my goodness, Mr. Shin.

00:52:46.607 --> 00:52:50.647
Try this free sample from Mr. Choi. It's brand new.

00:52:50.717 --> 00:52:53.017
Hey, if Mr. Choi gave it to you, why are you giving it to me?

00:52:53.287 --> 00:52:56.157
Hey, don't you remember what you told Mr. Choi last time?

00:52:56.217 --> 00:52:59.687
You told him to give free samples to Ttoli Super first.

00:53:00.687 --> 00:53:02.657
And he's been bringing them over ever since.

00:53:03.057 --> 00:53:05.757
Thanks. I'll enjoy it.

00:53:05.827 --> 00:53:10.237
- It's all thanks to you. - Thanks.

00:53:11.637 --> 00:53:12.907
- Hey. - Long time no see.

00:53:12.967 --> 00:53:15.107
Yes. Go ahead.

00:53:25.347 --> 00:53:26.347
Roll down the window.

00:53:26.647 --> 00:53:27.647
Down.

00:53:29.117 --> 00:53:31.587
- Why? - Why aren't you getting a move on?

00:53:31.657 --> 00:53:34.087
There's someone crossing in front of us.

00:53:34.157 --> 00:53:36.027
Don't you see all the cars waiting behind us?

00:53:36.097 --> 00:53:38.327
What are you even talking about?

00:53:39.257 --> 00:53:41.997
So what? Should I run people over and keep going?

00:53:42.067 --> 00:53:45.137
Of course not. I'm just in a hurry. The cars behind...

00:53:46.037 --> 00:53:50.177
You just violated the Traffic Act 49. License, please.

00:53:50.237 --> 00:53:51.277
I did what now?

00:53:51.337 --> 00:53:55.847
You were honking in a school zone and threatening the driver ahead.

00:53:55.907 --> 00:53:57.277
Your license, now!

00:53:57.377 --> 00:54:00.117
Can't you let this one slide?

00:54:00.117 --> 00:54:02.317
- No! Give it to me now! - I was just in a hurry...

00:54:02.317 --> 00:54:04.357
- At least three times a day. - I said give it to me, now!

00:54:04.357 --> 00:54:06.687
Throughout roughly 35 years of our working lives,

00:54:07.157 --> 00:54:10.257
we face about 40,000 choices, big and small.

00:54:15.197 --> 00:54:19.737
Ultimately, every moment of our life is a choice, a negotiation.

00:54:21.067 --> 00:54:23.907
Hey, do you know who this guy is?

00:54:24.437 --> 00:54:26.807
He's the punk who officiated your wedding!

00:54:27.107 --> 00:54:28.647
Everyone, you all saw that, right?

00:54:29.107 --> 00:54:30.577
You saw him, right?

00:54:31.217 --> 00:54:35.847
he's Chancellor Kim Kyung Soo? He's a waiter named Shin Kyoung Soo.

00:54:36.047 --> 00:54:39.527
He's a con artist! How could you let that bum do it?

00:54:39.527 --> 00:54:41.857
- You introduced him to me. - Come here.

00:54:41.857 --> 00:54:43.857
When did I ask you to find one?

00:54:44.227 --> 00:54:46.467
Hey! Do you know what this is?

00:54:46.967 --> 00:54:51.497
This is the wedding speech I wrote. It took me three whole days.

00:54:51.597 --> 00:54:55.167
Every time you got a new girlfriend, I rewrote the whole thing.

00:54:55.267 --> 00:54:56.837
A total of 26 times!

00:54:56.907 --> 00:54:58.477
What are you talking about? That's a crazy thing to say.

00:54:58.807 --> 00:55:00.807
When did I ever date 26 women?

00:55:00.907 --> 00:55:03.917
Wow, what a player. Seriously, a player!

00:55:03.977 --> 00:55:06.387
Should I jog your memory? Look.

00:55:06.447 --> 00:55:08.087
Eun Hye, Se Yeong, Seo Yeong...

00:55:08.147 --> 00:55:09.147
Seriously, what did you write in there?

00:55:09.217 --> 00:55:11.057
- Ah Seon, Jae Eun, Yun Hui... - Let me see that! Give it here!

00:55:11.117 --> 00:55:12.117
- Give me that. - Let go! Get off!

00:55:13.557 --> 00:55:15.687
This was expensive, you punk.

00:55:38.417 --> 00:55:39.687
What to give up...

00:55:40.687 --> 00:55:41.987
and what to protect.

00:55:42.787 --> 00:55:44.487
Establishing that baseline...

00:55:45.087 --> 00:55:46.457
is where negotiation begins.

00:55:47.087 --> 00:55:50.957
The important thing is to find a way to coexist.

00:55:51.827 --> 00:55:52.927
That's what Mr. Shin used to say.

00:56:37.237 --> 00:56:38.877
(Chicken Center)

00:56:47.487 --> 00:56:48.687
So, tell me,

00:56:49.147 --> 00:56:52.287
- What qualities make a good judge? - Well...

00:56:53.057 --> 00:56:57.127
I don't know about good judges, but you must be a good person first.

00:56:59.597 --> 00:57:03.267
You live up to your reputation. We've hit the jackpot with you.

00:57:03.667 --> 00:57:05.137
I feel like we've gained a powerful ally.

00:57:06.267 --> 00:57:09.777
It's for a good cause. While I was on the bench,

00:57:10.637 --> 00:57:11.907
I've often thought the same thing.

00:57:13.147 --> 00:57:15.547
Mucho

00:57:24.757 --> 00:57:27.657
I've got to change this password.

00:57:27.957 --> 00:57:31.327
How can just anyone waltz in and out of the shop when I'm not here?

00:57:31.397 --> 00:57:32.857
- Mr. Shin. - What?

00:57:32.857 --> 00:57:35.567
I'll have one whole fried chicken. And make the coffee...

00:57:35.627 --> 00:57:36.637
What?

00:57:37.667 --> 00:57:39.367
Son of a...

00:57:40.337 --> 00:57:41.737
- I'll make it. - Hey, sir...

00:57:41.807 --> 00:57:42.807
No, let me...

00:57:46.647 --> 00:57:49.347
- I'm here. - Si On.

00:57:49.977 --> 00:57:52.447
- Good to see you. You've been well? - Yes.

00:57:57.317 --> 00:57:58.387
Who's he?

00:58:08.097 --> 00:58:09.897
- Here you go. - Thank you. You first.

00:58:09.967 --> 00:58:10.967
No, please.

00:58:17.677 --> 00:58:20.107
- This is really good. - The fried chicken here is great.

00:58:20.247 --> 00:58:21.907
And not a bad place to work, either.

00:58:22.477 --> 00:58:23.477
Work?

00:58:28.787 --> 00:58:30.087
He's Mr. Shin.

00:58:32.117 --> 00:58:33.187
Oh!

00:58:33.527 --> 00:58:34.557
(Give and Take)

00:58:35.357 --> 00:58:38.127
I look forward to working with you! Mr. Shin!

00:58:47.237 --> 00:58:49.267
Great, another Pillip?

00:58:52.837 --> 00:58:54.047
Get ready!

00:58:56.877 --> 00:58:57.877
Yes.

00:59:14.567 --> 00:59:18.797
(Thank you to everyone who has supported Shin's Project)
