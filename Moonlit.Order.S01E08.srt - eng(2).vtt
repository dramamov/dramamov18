00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:52.043
Come on, Ms. Wang.

00:01:52.484 --> 00:01:53.644
We've been waiting.

00:01:54.603 --> 00:01:55.043
Sit.

00:02:03.803 --> 00:02:06.803
Ms. Wang has been with us
for some time now.

00:02:07.284 --> 00:02:09.843
I may be old, but I'm not blind.

00:02:10.604 --> 00:02:11.604
I believe

00:02:12.104 --> 00:02:15.764
she can no longer continue like this.

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:17.843
I hereby declare

00:02:18.324 --> 00:02:19.324
that starting today,

00:02:20.188 --> 00:02:23.788
Ms. Wang will formally
take over all household affairs.

00:02:24.628 --> 00:02:26.709
Let's begin with managing the accounts.

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:37.109
(Alright.)

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:39.908
(If they are hiding
the former Crown Prince,)

00:02:40.168 --> 00:02:41.269
(there will be expenses.)

00:02:41.908 --> 00:02:43.068
(I can audit the accounts)

00:02:43.348 --> 00:02:44.149
(and find clues.)

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:45.269
I disagree.

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:48.149
Managing accounts isn't that simple.

00:02:48.948 --> 00:02:50.269
If her calculations are wrong,

00:02:50.788 --> 00:02:52.508
we will fall into chaos.

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:53.829
That's easy.

00:02:55.068 --> 00:02:56.269
Just test her abilities.

00:02:58.228 --> 00:02:58.748
Tell me.

00:03:00.348 --> 00:03:03.508
Two thousand nine hundred sixty-eight

00:03:03.948 --> 00:03:04.628
multiplied by

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:06.228
four hundred fifty-six

00:03:06.348 --> 00:03:06.829
equals?

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.109
One million three hundred
fifty-three thousand four hundred eight.

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.269
One million three hundred
fifty-three thousand four hundred...

00:03:20.068 --> 00:03:20.748
Correct.

00:03:26.348 --> 00:03:29.068
Thirteen thousand
six hundred eighty-nine

00:03:29.468 --> 00:03:31.029
divided by thirty-nine equals?

00:03:31.468 --> 00:03:32.468
Three hundred fifty-one.

00:03:36.748 --> 00:03:37.508
Correct again.

00:03:40.668 --> 00:03:41.228
That's right.

00:03:41.668 --> 00:03:42.748
We verified it yesterday.

00:03:43.068 --> 00:03:44.149
It was 351.

00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:47.908
She did it even without an abacus.

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:50.989
(Xue Guardians can handle math.)

00:03:53.348 --> 00:03:56.709
Ms. Wang has such math skills.

00:03:57.228 --> 00:03:59.628
What a blessing for the Xue family.

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:02.149
Jiaoqian.

00:04:02.348 --> 00:04:03.549
We can't let

00:04:03.788 --> 00:04:05.029
her rare skill go to waste.

00:04:05.668 --> 00:04:06.429
Ms. Wang.

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:09.589
Hexu has been managing the accounts.

00:04:09.748 --> 00:04:11.709
If you have any questions,

00:04:11.788 --> 00:04:12.668
just ask him.

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:13.908
Understood.

00:04:19.348 --> 00:04:20.629
You've repeatedly

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.228
protected our family members these days.

00:04:23.908 --> 00:04:26.189
You're a good-hearted young woman.

00:04:27.108 --> 00:04:28.389
I feel reassured to entrust

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:29.908
the household to you.

00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:31.629
Thank you, Madam.

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:53.308
Honey, what's wrong?

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.908
Dongyang,

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.548
do you also agree
to let Stepmother take over?

00:04:58.988 --> 00:05:00.189
She is a capable woman.

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:02.589
And she's been
holding our family together.

00:05:03.208 --> 00:05:04.629
I don't see a problem here.

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:06.509
I see all kinds of problems.

00:05:07.788 --> 00:05:09.468
You're just too innocent.

00:05:10.228 --> 00:05:11.348
She's up to something.

00:05:14.788 --> 00:05:15.308
You...

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.829
Grandmother,

00:05:27.548 --> 00:05:29.149
I have a question.

00:05:30.108 --> 00:05:32.189
Hexu was handling accounts
perfectly well.

00:05:32.788 --> 00:05:35.108
Why did you suddenly
ask Stepmother to take over?

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.788
Hexu has always been narrow-minded

00:05:39.668 --> 00:05:41.428
and opposed Ms. Wang at every turn.

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:44.788
He doesn't want her
to expand the family line.

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:47.589
What I mean is,

00:05:47.908 --> 00:05:48.749
over these years,

00:05:49.228 --> 00:05:51.788
Hexu has exhausted himself
for the Xue family.

00:05:52.308 --> 00:05:54.788
Any children Ms. Wang bears

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:57.749
would naturally be the legitimate heirs.

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:59.629
Ms. Wang's position

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:02.149
should naturally precede Hexu's.

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.589
But Hexu is also a legitimate heir.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.269
That's not what I meant.

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:10.668
I'm saying

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:13.269
the burden of account management

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:17.069
must eventually
be entrusted to your father's wife.

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:19.829
I see.

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:23.189
You saw Hexu burdened by this task.

00:06:23.308 --> 00:06:24.029
So you made

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:26.108
Stepmother share his burden.

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:28.788
You're the best, Grandmother.

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:49.868
Shops.

00:06:50.269 --> 00:06:51.108
Fields.

00:06:51.548 --> 00:06:52.348
Workshops.

00:06:53.672 --> 00:06:54.760
(Account Book)

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:57.108
Got it.

00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:58.308
Look at this.

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:01.428
Xue Hexu really knows

00:07:01.868 --> 00:07:03.428
how to scheme for money.

00:07:12.072 --> 00:07:13.428
So sneaky...

00:07:15.108 --> 00:07:15.829
Are you fine?

00:07:17.548 --> 00:07:18.509
You were out all night.

00:07:18.668 --> 00:07:19.709
I got worried.

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:21.189
Found the painting?

00:07:23.428 --> 00:07:24.949
(Xue Hexu is full of tricks.)

00:07:25.128 --> 00:07:26.788
(I can't tell him about the painting.)

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:29.108
I was worried that

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:30.908
the Grand Tutor might notice

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:32.069
and implicate you.

00:07:32.428 --> 00:07:33.908
So I stayed out for hours

00:07:34.269 --> 00:07:35.509
before returning.

00:07:38.108 --> 00:07:39.149
How thoughtful of you.

00:07:39.829 --> 00:07:40.389
It's fine.

00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:42.308
We'll come up with

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:43.868
another plan.

00:07:45.228 --> 00:07:45.868
Perhaps

00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:48.468
I've caused too much trouble.

00:07:48.668 --> 00:07:49.749
So, Grandmother let you

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:51.468
take over the account books.

00:07:53.908 --> 00:07:55.788
Or maybe your grandmother thought

00:07:56.308 --> 00:07:57.829
you'd been working too hard

00:07:58.189 --> 00:07:59.228
and asked me to assist.

00:08:04.168 --> 00:08:04.829
Of course.

00:08:05.509 --> 00:08:06.428
It's possible that

00:08:06.709 --> 00:08:07.749
she dislikes you.

00:08:13.788 --> 00:08:14.908
You have family troubles,

00:08:15.308 --> 00:08:16.509
while I have no family.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.308
If anyone disrespects me,

00:08:19.908 --> 00:08:20.829
I'll cut them down.

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:22.829
If they disrespect me,

00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:24.908
I'll make them fear me.

00:08:28.788 --> 00:08:29.428
It's fine.

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:32.588
I don't mind as long as you mean well

00:08:32.788 --> 00:08:33.869
for the Xue family.

00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:37.588
(Does he think I'm comforting him?)

00:08:38.749 --> 00:08:40.029
(I'm not. I didn't.)

00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:40.948
(No way.)

00:08:42.229 --> 00:08:42.629
Alright.

00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:44.428
Let me show you our shops.

00:08:50.472 --> 00:08:52.808
(Xue Street)

00:08:53.188 --> 00:08:54.229
The Xue Street

00:08:54.509 --> 00:08:57.588
was funded and built
by my family years ago.

00:08:58.548 --> 00:08:59.509
The local government

00:08:59.708 --> 00:09:01.068
wanted to thank us.

00:09:01.308 --> 00:09:03.869
So they named it Xue Street. Right?

00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.989
Not quite.

00:09:06.668 --> 00:09:07.948
They wanted to thank us

00:09:08.149 --> 00:09:10.308
and sent us a crate of farm eggs,

00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.989
sacks of rice,

00:09:11.188 --> 00:09:12.269
and rapeseed oil.

00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:13.828
They even hired the best painter

00:09:13.869 --> 00:09:14.989
to paint us at our house

00:09:15.349 --> 00:09:16.989
and publish the painting

00:09:16.989 --> 00:09:18.428
in the daily gazette.

00:09:18.989 --> 00:09:19.588
However,

00:09:19.629 --> 00:09:21.068
Grandfather rejected the idea

00:09:21.188 --> 00:09:22.588
and insisted on naming it

00:09:22.788 --> 00:09:23.708
Xue Street.

00:09:26.708 --> 00:09:28.908
Your grandfather
was a true man of principle.

00:09:32.469 --> 00:09:33.828
I'm from Swiftwind Security.

00:09:34.068 --> 00:09:34.869
Should we deliver

00:09:35.109 --> 00:09:37.029
the seafood shop's goods this afternoon?

00:09:37.469 --> 00:09:38.308
That's right.

00:09:38.668 --> 00:09:39.109
Understood.

00:09:40.488 --> 00:09:41.229
(Escort Agency)

00:09:41.229 --> 00:09:42.788
Their rent must be high.

00:09:43.229 --> 00:09:44.828
You only see part of the picture.

00:09:45.349 --> 00:09:47.749
The escort agency may seem
to occupy a large space.

00:09:47.869 --> 00:09:48.469
But this is

00:09:48.708 --> 00:09:50.788
necessary for logistics and storage.

00:09:50.948 --> 00:09:52.389
They also keep the street safe

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:53.509
and transport things.

00:09:53.908 --> 00:09:55.308
It's a win-win.

00:09:56.629 --> 00:09:57.708
I see.

00:09:59.848 --> 00:10:02.308
(Moonlit Luxury)

00:10:02.308 --> 00:10:03.428
Can't even afford a bag!

00:10:04.668 --> 00:10:05.068
Honey.

00:10:05.349 --> 00:10:06.109
Honey.

00:10:26.188 --> 00:10:26.948
Ms. Gui.

00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:28.869
Run your business honestly,

00:10:29.109 --> 00:10:30.869
or I'll raise your rent next month.

00:10:32.109 --> 00:10:34.068
Are you raising my rent

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.428
because it's easy to bully a woman?

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:41.708
Why are you bullying her?

00:10:43.708 --> 00:10:44.229
Madam.

00:10:44.989 --> 00:10:45.989
When will the bag

00:10:46.109 --> 00:10:46.989
be restocked?

00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:49.629
That model is extremely popular.

00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:50.308
Keep waiting.

00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:52.828
Why did Mr. Wang's third concubine

00:10:52.989 --> 00:10:54.068
get hers yesterday?

00:10:54.536 --> 00:10:56.068
She also

00:10:56.068 --> 00:10:58.188
purchased a coin purse,

00:10:58.188 --> 00:11:00.109
water flask, watch, and bamboo hat

00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:02.029
to get that bag.

00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.788
Then

00:11:04.469 --> 00:11:05.869
how much would it be?

00:11:05.896 --> 00:11:07.428
Our customers

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.629
would never fuss over petty expenses.

00:11:09.948 --> 00:11:11.029
After all, this bag

00:11:11.188 --> 00:11:12.308
doesn't suit

00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:14.149
those who don't have money.

00:11:14.149 --> 00:11:14.668
You...

00:11:14.749 --> 00:11:15.908
It was out of stock,

00:11:16.349 --> 00:11:17.788
but you sold one to another lady.

00:11:18.229 --> 00:11:19.989
Are you pulling some magic trick here?

00:11:27.828 --> 00:11:28.788
You clearly have

00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:30.308
many bags in stock.

00:11:31.588 --> 00:11:32.948
Alright. This is a scam!

00:11:33.869 --> 00:11:34.708
It's not a scam.

00:11:35.149 --> 00:11:36.269
It's a bundle purchase.

00:11:37.229 --> 00:11:37.828
Bundle purchase?

00:11:39.349 --> 00:11:40.269
It means

00:11:40.588 --> 00:11:42.389
she's forcing you to buy

00:11:42.668 --> 00:11:45.149
these outdated trinkets

00:11:45.308 --> 00:11:46.029
with the bag.

00:11:48.668 --> 00:11:49.149
Ms. Gui.

00:11:49.869 --> 00:11:51.068
I've told you many times

00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:52.668
to run an honest business.

00:11:53.109 --> 00:11:54.109
Raising your rent

00:11:54.349 --> 00:11:55.269
was a warning.

00:11:55.629 --> 00:11:56.548
But you don't change.

00:11:57.349 --> 00:11:58.629
I'm revoking your shop lease.

00:11:58.908 --> 00:12:00.068
Move out next month.

00:12:00.068 --> 00:12:01.389
Just like that?

00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:02.749
We signed a contract.

00:12:03.149 --> 00:12:05.548
You break promises and jack up prices

00:12:05.548 --> 00:12:06.349
on a whim!

00:12:07.428 --> 00:12:08.509
Be the judge.

00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:09.588
Let's report it.

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:11.109
What are you doing?

00:12:12.708 --> 00:12:13.068
What...?

00:12:13.908 --> 00:12:14.469
This is

00:12:14.788 --> 00:12:16.749
the contract we signed.

00:12:17.188 --> 00:12:17.989
It clearly states

00:12:18.269 --> 00:12:19.349
that if you don't run

00:12:19.548 --> 00:12:20.548
(Lease Contract)
an honest business,

00:12:20.908 --> 00:12:22.428
(Lessor: Xue Fugui, Lessee: Gui Xiang)
I can reclaim the shop.

00:12:23.109 --> 00:12:25.548
But you owe me tenfold the annual rent.

00:12:27.816 --> 00:12:32.989
(Moonlit Luxury)

00:12:32.989 --> 00:12:33.869
You let her off?

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:35.548
This much is enough.

00:12:35.828 --> 00:12:36.629
She will learn.

00:12:38.029 --> 00:12:38.509
Take it.

00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:47.788
(He looks and sounds)

00:12:47.944 --> 00:12:48.869
(like a brat,)

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:50.469
(but has decent character.)

00:12:53.064 --> 00:12:53.668
(Wait.)

00:12:54.869 --> 00:12:56.149
(Why am I praising him?)

00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:03.368
(Administrative Office)

00:13:03.368 --> 00:13:05.121
(Jing'an Bureau Procedures)

00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:08.188
Thank you.

00:13:08.588 --> 00:13:09.389
Thank you, my lord.

00:13:10.788 --> 00:13:11.548
Next.

00:13:12.989 --> 00:13:13.428
Mr. Gu.

00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:14.109
Greetings.

00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:15.029
Mr. Gu is here.

00:13:15.828 --> 00:13:17.029
Let's see what 27 says.

00:13:17.428 --> 00:13:18.469
What's your problem?

00:13:19.752 --> 00:13:21.512
(9527)

00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:24.109
27?

00:13:25.828 --> 00:13:26.788
Mr. Gu.

00:13:28.428 --> 00:13:29.629
Long time no see.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:31.749
Got it.

00:13:39.176 --> 00:13:43.464
(9527)

00:13:49.229 --> 00:13:49.668
Here.

00:14:20.548 --> 00:14:21.109
What?

00:14:24.349 --> 00:14:25.109
It's your salary.

00:14:25.588 --> 00:14:26.068
Whose?

00:14:26.349 --> 00:14:27.109
Yours.

00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:31.869
What?

00:14:32.308 --> 00:14:33.349
It's your salary.

00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:34.029
Whose?

00:14:34.029 --> 00:14:34.869
Yours.

00:14:37.989 --> 00:14:38.828
Stop kidding.

00:14:38.948 --> 00:14:39.708
One wen?

00:14:40.229 --> 00:14:41.109
Mr. Gu.

00:14:41.428 --> 00:14:42.229
You know

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:44.229
you don't have a fixed wage.

00:14:44.828 --> 00:14:46.788
You had no missions this month.

00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:48.040
Hence,

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:50.149
the little pay.

00:14:51.548 --> 00:14:52.629
I had no missions?

00:14:52.749 --> 00:14:53.948
Didn't I follow

00:14:53.989 --> 00:14:55.149
Xue Hexu and Feng Zuoren

00:14:55.229 --> 00:14:55.869
for clues?

00:14:57.469 --> 00:14:59.029
But you made no progress.

00:15:04.509 --> 00:15:05.828
No progress?

00:15:06.349 --> 00:15:08.908
So no payment?

00:15:09.989 --> 00:15:10.548
Mr. Gu.

00:15:13.029 --> 00:15:14.668
Don't make this hard for me.

00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:24.708
Alright, 27.

00:15:54.708 --> 00:15:55.588
Anyone here?

00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:02.188
Is anybody here?

00:16:14.229 --> 00:16:14.749
What are you doing?

00:16:15.869 --> 00:16:16.668
Taking a dump.

00:16:17.068 --> 00:16:17.509
Taking...

00:16:19.149 --> 00:16:20.509
In the storage room?

00:16:21.229 --> 00:16:21.948
None of your business.

00:16:22.869 --> 00:16:23.588
What do you want?

00:16:32.296 --> 00:16:33.428
I heard you offer

00:16:33.588 --> 00:16:34.788
short-term employment

00:16:35.349 --> 00:16:36.109
opportunities.

00:16:37.548 --> 00:16:37.989
Yes.

00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:39.989
Turn screws in the south.

00:16:40.349 --> 00:16:41.548
Haul bricks in the north.

00:16:42.588 --> 00:16:43.828
Harvest kidneys westward.

00:16:43.989 --> 00:16:45.029
Take lives on the spot.

00:16:45.229 --> 00:16:47.068
I have all kinds of great jobs here.

00:16:47.708 --> 00:16:48.509
Pick one.

00:16:49.948 --> 00:16:52.308
The one with
the highest reward, of course.

00:16:52.749 --> 00:16:53.548
Alright.

00:16:55.629 --> 00:16:57.269
A commission just came in today.

00:16:57.389 --> 00:16:58.828
Urgent and important.

00:16:59.629 --> 00:17:00.989
Are you willing to take a life?

00:17:01.389 --> 00:17:02.548
Easy peasy.

00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:03.269
How much?

00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:04.509
Two liang.

00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:08.108
A human life for just two liang?

00:17:08.308 --> 00:17:09.108
Buddy,

00:17:09.348 --> 00:17:11.229
the uphill climb
is always tough at first.

00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:12.308
Will you do it?

00:17:15.548 --> 00:17:15.909
Yes.

00:17:16.788 --> 00:17:18.388
Such jobs are my specialty.

00:17:21.068 --> 00:17:23.515
(Bounty Order No. 57)

00:17:25.108 --> 00:17:26.348
(Xue Hexu?)

00:17:30.269 --> 00:17:30.909
Just wait.

00:17:34.068 --> 00:17:34.909
Don't poop here.

00:17:35.108 --> 00:17:35.749
None of your business.

00:17:36.068 --> 00:17:37.068
Why do you care?

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:44.904
(Xue Street)

00:17:52.348 --> 00:17:53.308
I'd like to thank you.

00:17:54.749 --> 00:17:56.068
You're a real go-getter,

00:17:56.749 --> 00:17:57.749
but one word from others

00:17:58.189 --> 00:17:59.308
could end your life.

00:18:00.628 --> 00:18:01.308
Human life

00:18:01.429 --> 00:18:02.909
is the most precious thing.

00:18:03.949 --> 00:18:06.148
Only the living get to
experience good fortune.

00:18:07.548 --> 00:18:08.108
From now on,

00:18:08.429 --> 00:18:09.828
I'll investigate with you.

00:18:12.788 --> 00:18:14.749
You apologized once
with the cherry blossom cake.

00:18:15.509 --> 00:18:16.868
Now you're giving me more?

00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:18.989
Why is that?

00:18:19.788 --> 00:18:20.588
Shouldn't

00:18:20.588 --> 00:18:21.749
young ladies all like

00:18:21.749 --> 00:18:23.469
soft pink pastries?

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:25.628
Am I wrong?

00:18:28.148 --> 00:18:29.669
I've lost my mind.

00:18:30.269 --> 00:18:31.669
What was I even expecting?

00:18:36.429 --> 00:18:37.229
Miss, Sir.

00:18:37.429 --> 00:18:38.148
Check these fans.

00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:40.388
Look at these exquisite paintings.

00:18:52.148 --> 00:18:53.628
In broad daylight.

00:18:54.548 --> 00:18:55.949
Stepson and stepmother.

00:18:57.229 --> 00:18:59.029
That's Feng Zuoren we're talking about.

00:18:59.688 --> 00:19:00.949
Xue Hexu,

00:19:01.788 --> 00:19:03.709
you're so desperate.

00:19:04.868 --> 00:19:06.909
No wonder someone wants you dead.

00:19:08.308 --> 00:19:10.548
Utterly despicable.

00:19:17.928 --> 00:19:19.509
Miss, this one suits you.

00:19:29.548 --> 00:19:30.469
You like this fan?

00:19:30.709 --> 00:19:31.108
I'll pay.

00:19:31.429 --> 00:19:32.348
We're being followed.

00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:39.189
Alright.

00:19:40.269 --> 00:19:41.189
Today,

00:19:42.308 --> 00:19:44.269
I'll enact heaven's justice

00:19:45.108 --> 00:19:46.828
and take your life

00:19:47.828 --> 00:19:49.348
and feed you to the dogs.

00:19:50.588 --> 00:19:51.029
Let's go.

00:19:58.709 --> 00:19:59.189
Miss.

00:19:59.388 --> 00:20:01.068
Take a look at this. It's lovely.

00:20:06.472 --> 00:20:08.348
Two eggs. Two quail eggs.

00:20:08.429 --> 00:20:09.469
Five wen. Pay up.

00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:12.868
Two eggs. Two quail eggs.

00:20:12.868 --> 00:20:13.669
Five wen?

00:20:13.828 --> 00:20:15.588
I'll report you to the Market Office.

00:20:20.148 --> 00:20:20.628
Not enough.

00:20:21.989 --> 00:20:22.828
Crooked merchant.

00:20:28.828 --> 00:20:29.548
You ruined my plan.

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:34.068
(What is this place?)

00:20:34.469 --> 00:20:36.029
(Why did they come here sneakily?)

00:20:37.628 --> 00:20:38.189
(Where are they?)

00:20:39.148 --> 00:20:40.029
Gu Qianfu.

00:20:46.749 --> 00:20:47.788
You're following me?

00:20:48.989 --> 00:20:49.749
How dare you?

00:20:50.388 --> 00:20:51.229
Following you?

00:20:51.949 --> 00:20:53.429
You flatter yourself.

00:21:15.229 --> 00:21:17.189
You're about to die.
Stop being so clingy.

00:21:17.788 --> 00:21:18.509
Xue Hexu,

00:21:18.868 --> 00:21:19.868
prepare to die.

00:21:24.189 --> 00:21:25.669
(Gu Qianfu wants to kill Xue Hexu?)

00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:26.509
(Wait.)

00:21:26.989 --> 00:21:28.068
(Why should I save him?)

00:21:35.469 --> 00:21:37.548
(I obtained
the former Crown Prince's portrait.)

00:21:38.148 --> 00:21:40.388
(I shouldn't care if Xue Hexu dies.)

00:21:53.868 --> 00:21:55.029
We have no feud.

00:21:55.469 --> 00:21:56.628
Why do you want me dead?

00:22:00.229 --> 00:22:01.509
Someone paid handsomely

00:22:02.548 --> 00:22:03.628
for your head.

00:22:04.308 --> 00:22:04.868
How much?

00:22:19.108 --> 00:22:19.949
That's your question?

00:22:24.548 --> 00:22:25.868
You work for the bounty

00:22:25.868 --> 00:22:27.509
instead of following orders.

00:22:28.189 --> 00:22:28.868
Who exactly

00:22:28.989 --> 00:22:30.108
wants Xue Hexu dead?

00:22:32.148 --> 00:22:33.348
(So nosy.)

00:22:33.828 --> 00:22:35.029
(Get a taste of)

00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:37.029
(your own Bone-Eroding Powder.)

00:22:37.788 --> 00:22:38.828
What a nuisance.

00:22:39.509 --> 00:22:41.469
You keep ruining my plans.

00:22:43.068 --> 00:22:45.388
(Today I'll kill two birds
with one stone,)

00:22:45.588 --> 00:22:47.548
(settling old and new grudges.)

00:22:49.828 --> 00:22:50.588
Go.

00:23:04.348 --> 00:23:05.669
Leave.

00:23:15.989 --> 00:23:18.709
I'll let you lovebirds die together.

00:23:21.709 --> 00:23:22.429
No.

00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:25.269
No!

00:24:01.148 --> 00:24:02.788
Xue Hexu.

00:24:03.388 --> 00:24:04.909
So many people want you dead.

00:24:05.628 --> 00:24:07.509
You must've committed countless evils

00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:08.949
and deserve to die.

00:24:11.229 --> 00:24:13.828
To think Feng Zuoren
will keep you company,

00:24:17.628 --> 00:24:18.828
it's creeping me out.

00:24:21.068 --> 00:24:22.308
I guess I rid the world

00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:23.709
of evil.

00:24:26.628 --> 00:24:27.709
First victory achieved.

00:24:27.868 --> 00:24:30.429
I'll be rolling in riches from now on.

00:25:12.788 --> 00:25:13.308
Wake up.

00:25:14.189 --> 00:25:14.749
Wake up.

00:25:24.148 --> 00:25:25.429
This pit's dark, damp,

00:25:26.509 --> 00:25:27.669
and it's monsoon.

00:25:28.788 --> 00:25:30.348
There's a faint miasma lingering.

00:25:31.348 --> 00:25:32.828
We need to find a way out soon.

00:25:33.736 --> 00:25:35.108
Or we'll die here.

00:25:51.368 --> 00:25:52.189
I'm cold.

00:25:58.408 --> 00:25:59.148
I'm cold.

00:25:59.868 --> 00:26:00.868
So cold.
