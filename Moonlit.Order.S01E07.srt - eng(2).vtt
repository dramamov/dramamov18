Hexu, she is dying.

00:04:48.904 --> 00:04:49.454
What to do?

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:56.008
Take care of her.

00:04:56.454 --> 00:04:56.974
Wait for me.

00:04:56.974 --> 00:04:57.493
Okay.

00:05:03.464 --> 00:05:05.320
(Jing'an Bureau)

00:05:17.253 --> 00:05:18.654
Greetings, sir.

00:05:20.214 --> 00:05:21.493
Look who it is.

00:05:22.173 --> 00:05:23.784
You're Xue Hexu

00:05:23.784 --> 00:05:26.574
who embarrassed me
at the Flower Banquet.

00:05:27.317 --> 00:05:28.957
What brings you here today?

00:05:29.798 --> 00:05:31.158
Want to dismantle my mansion?

00:05:31.478 --> 00:05:32.158
I was foolish

00:05:32.798 --> 00:05:34.877
and failed your concern for my father.

00:05:35.637 --> 00:05:37.317
You warned me at the Flower Banquet,

00:05:37.598 --> 00:05:38.798
yet I failed to be alert

00:05:39.197 --> 00:05:40.757
and got my father poisoned by villains,

00:05:40.957 --> 00:05:41.918
with his life in danger.

00:05:42.408 --> 00:05:43.877
I'm here to beg for the antidote.

00:05:44.136 --> 00:05:46.358
Please help us.

00:05:48.678 --> 00:05:50.077
Lord Dingyuan has been poisoned?

00:05:51.397 --> 00:05:51.838
Yes.

00:05:53.197 --> 00:05:53.877
Diagnosis shows

00:05:54.238 --> 00:05:55.397
it's Deadly Poison.

00:05:56.038 --> 00:05:57.397
Common physicians can't treat it.

00:05:58.238 --> 00:05:59.557
If you offer help,

00:06:00.077 --> 00:06:01.637
I'll repay you

00:06:01.918 --> 00:06:02.718
even with my life.

00:06:08.557 --> 00:06:09.718
As colleagues,

00:06:11.038 --> 00:06:13.077
I can't stand idle.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.358
But you know what?

00:06:16.437 --> 00:06:18.397
Deadly Poison is a peculiar poison.

00:06:19.598 --> 00:06:20.957
Let's be honest,

00:06:22.517 --> 00:06:24.238
Lord Dingyuan

00:06:24.478 --> 00:06:25.877
crossed the line and did wrong

00:06:26.278 --> 00:06:29.278
at the prince's incident a decade ago.

00:06:29.918 --> 00:06:30.798
I bet he's

00:06:32.118 --> 00:06:33.397
targeted by someone.

00:06:34.437 --> 00:06:36.478
I can save him now,

00:06:36.877 --> 00:06:38.678
not forever.

00:06:41.118 --> 00:06:42.478
If you offer help,

00:06:42.718 --> 00:06:44.678
the Xue family will remember this grace.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.757
If you want to ask questions,

00:06:47.437 --> 00:06:48.397
I can give you answers

00:06:48.877 --> 00:06:50.718
after my father's recovery.

00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:52.317
Please wait

00:06:53.118 --> 00:06:53.877
for a few days.

00:06:54.317 --> 00:06:55.557
You want

00:06:56.798 --> 00:06:59.358
to take my antidote today,

00:07:00.118 --> 00:07:01.557
yet make me wait days

00:07:01.718 --> 00:07:03.278
for answers?

00:07:04.077 --> 00:07:05.158
I beg for your mercy.

00:07:11.757 --> 00:07:12.197
Right.

00:07:12.957 --> 00:07:14.997
Do you possess

00:07:14.997 --> 00:07:16.678
a portrait of the late empress?

00:07:17.397 --> 00:07:18.637
Give it to me,

00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:20.838
and I'll give you the antidote.

00:07:22.158 --> 00:07:23.317
(Why do they all want that?)

00:07:26.358 --> 00:07:26.838
Okay.

00:07:26.997 --> 00:07:27.798
The painting

00:07:28.757 --> 00:07:29.478
for the antidote.

00:07:30.184 --> 00:07:30.637
Go.

00:07:39.238 --> 00:07:41.118
Lord Dingyuan has been poisoned?

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.877
Lord Dingyuan has been poisoned.

00:07:46.077 --> 00:07:47.877
Lord Dingyuan has been poisoned.

00:07:50.792 --> 00:07:52.118
Nuannuan, here.

00:08:08.158 --> 00:08:09.077
What to do, Hexu?

00:08:09.238 --> 00:08:10.637
Her hands grow colder.

00:08:10.997 --> 00:08:11.557
Start a fire.

00:08:11.918 --> 00:08:12.358
Got it.

00:08:23.877 --> 00:08:24.278
Alright.

00:08:25.278 --> 00:08:25.757
I'm here.

00:08:27.278 --> 00:08:28.077
So cold.

00:08:29.238 --> 00:08:29.957
So cold.

00:08:41.198 --> 00:08:41.718
(Ms. Wang,)

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:42.997
(hang on.)

00:08:43.997 --> 00:08:44.558
(Hang on.)

00:08:47.157 --> 00:08:47.718
(Ms. Wang,)

00:08:48.677 --> 00:08:49.718
(you'll recover soon.)

00:08:53.637 --> 00:08:54.517
(Why be so silly?)

00:08:56.478 --> 00:08:58.198
(What matters more than life?)

00:08:59.037 --> 00:08:59.997
(Why took the poison?)

00:09:01.438 --> 00:09:02.677
(What are you hiding?)

00:09:10.078 --> 00:09:11.318
Why do you live

00:09:12.558 --> 00:09:13.757
such a difficult life?

00:09:21.677 --> 00:09:23.637
I still found sweetness in such moments.

00:09:24.238 --> 00:09:25.438
I'm truly heartless.

00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.718
Hexu, is she alright now?

00:09:52.078 --> 00:09:52.877
Young Master,

00:09:53.757 --> 00:09:54.517
don't go.

00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:12.598
Get out.

00:10:34.917 --> 00:10:35.438
I...

00:10:38.037 --> 00:10:38.877
I didn't die.

00:10:40.438 --> 00:10:41.958
Hexu begged for the antidote.

00:10:44.157 --> 00:10:45.997
(Deadly Poison
belongs to Jing'an Bureau.)

00:10:46.718 --> 00:10:48.358
(Did he go to Grand Tutor Zhou?)

00:10:50.118 --> 00:10:51.877
(How could he leave unscathed?)

00:10:55.318 --> 00:10:55.757
Come on.

00:10:56.078 --> 00:10:57.397
Chicken soup stewed with ginseng.

00:10:57.598 --> 00:10:58.277
Let her drink it.

00:10:58.877 --> 00:10:59.464
Jiaoqian.

00:10:59.797 --> 00:11:02.198
When Dongyang had raging fever,
you didn't use this ginseng.

00:11:02.718 --> 00:11:04.958
Now you've stewed this?

00:11:05.517 --> 00:11:06.637
Why save me?

00:11:07.797 --> 00:11:08.958
I should be dead.

00:11:15.118 --> 00:11:15.917
Everyone out.

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:32.118
Why do you

00:11:33.238 --> 00:11:34.517
always speak of death?

00:11:35.078 --> 00:11:35.997
Once dead,

00:11:36.318 --> 00:11:37.238
you can do nothing.

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:39.198
Nosy.

00:11:39.917 --> 00:11:40.958
Those truly wishing to die

00:11:41.558 --> 00:11:43.037
don't struggle for life like you do.

00:11:44.397 --> 00:11:45.478
Your family has gone.

00:11:46.118 --> 00:11:48.198
They wouldn't want you
joining them so soon.

00:11:50.397 --> 00:11:51.558
You know nothing.

00:11:52.277 --> 00:11:52.757
Yes,

00:11:53.438 --> 00:11:54.037
you're right.

00:11:54.718 --> 00:11:56.037
Because you've never been frank.

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:01.958
Do you know saving me

00:12:02.838 --> 00:12:04.397
will bring disaster to Xue family?

00:12:04.797 --> 00:12:06.358
The Xue family has suffered a lot.

00:12:07.797 --> 00:12:08.558
But we

00:12:09.157 --> 00:12:10.677
won't abandon those in need.

00:12:11.238 --> 00:12:12.478
Everyone has

00:12:13.198 --> 00:12:14.397
to look out for themselves.

00:12:14.637 --> 00:12:16.797
I can say the same words to you.

00:12:18.078 --> 00:12:19.157
If you seek death again,

00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:20.958
I won't

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.198
stop you anymore.

00:12:26.198 --> 00:12:26.757
Rest now.

00:12:27.598 --> 00:12:28.198
I'll leave.

00:12:40.078 --> 00:12:41.797
I blamed you when Dongyang went missing,

00:12:42.157 --> 00:12:43.318
but he's back now.

00:12:43.877 --> 00:12:45.157
Why sought death?

00:12:46.277 --> 00:12:47.558
Come to us with problems.

00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.198
We'll figure it out.

00:12:50.078 --> 00:12:51.358
Our family's already in chaos.

00:12:52.078 --> 00:12:53.238
If anything happens to you,

00:12:53.677 --> 00:12:55.118
the Xue family will collapse.

00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:56.598
Stepmother.

00:12:57.397 --> 00:12:58.917
I'll behave from now on.

00:12:59.677 --> 00:13:00.997
Don't be upset

00:13:01.797 --> 00:13:02.917
and leave me.

00:13:03.624 --> 00:13:05.238
I like you.

00:13:26.598 --> 00:13:28.797
(If Feng Zuoren hadn't caused trouble,)

00:13:29.358 --> 00:13:31.198
(letting Hua Biliang escape,)

00:13:31.917 --> 00:13:34.198
(I'd never have tracked him down.)

00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.598
(Now that Xue Hexu
gave me the painting,)

00:13:37.757 --> 00:13:39.797
(it's time to use him.)

00:13:40.917 --> 00:13:42.598
(With this person here,)

00:13:43.037 --> 00:13:45.677
(let's see how long you can
keep it a secret, Lord Dingyuan.)

00:14:04.104 --> 00:14:06.216
(Emperor's Portrait, Empress's Portrait)

00:14:11.358 --> 00:14:12.397
I have my rules.

00:14:13.718 --> 00:14:14.397
If you

00:14:15.078 --> 00:14:17.438
expect me to sketch their son

00:14:17.997 --> 00:14:18.997
from these two portraits,

00:14:21.397 --> 00:14:22.838
don't bother asking.

00:14:32.838 --> 00:14:33.877
You misunderstand.

00:14:39.677 --> 00:14:41.037
Sorry to make you suffer.

00:14:42.198 --> 00:14:43.797
I just tried to test you.

00:14:44.598 --> 00:14:46.757
Seeing your integrity,

00:14:47.198 --> 00:14:48.598
I dare confide in you now.

00:14:49.677 --> 00:14:50.718
If we are

00:14:50.917 --> 00:14:52.958
trying to protect ordinary people,

00:14:53.677 --> 00:14:56.277
why would I go this far and do all this?

00:14:59.797 --> 00:15:00.397
What

00:15:01.438 --> 00:15:02.397
do you want exactly?

00:15:05.877 --> 00:15:08.677
It was safe that no one
knows the whereabouts

00:15:09.277 --> 00:15:10.358
of the former Crown Prince.

00:15:11.797 --> 00:15:12.838
But now His Majesty

00:15:13.037 --> 00:15:16.037
sees the former Crown Prince
as a thorn in his flesh,

00:15:16.558 --> 00:15:17.677
he'd spare no one

00:15:17.877 --> 00:15:18.958
even it means to kill.

00:15:20.198 --> 00:15:21.677
If we stand by idly,

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:23.917
the former Crown Prince

00:15:24.838 --> 00:15:26.078
will only be waiting to die.

00:15:28.598 --> 00:15:29.958
His Majesty

00:15:30.238 --> 00:15:31.118
is getting frail.

00:15:31.997 --> 00:15:32.598
Recently,

00:15:33.517 --> 00:15:35.238
he's obsessed
with immortality practices.

00:15:36.917 --> 00:15:38.157
He neglects state affairs

00:15:39.277 --> 00:15:40.037
and people.

00:15:41.397 --> 00:15:42.917
The people grumble with discontent.

00:15:44.078 --> 00:15:44.637
And officials

00:15:45.832 --> 00:15:47.037
dare not voice their anger.

00:15:50.997 --> 00:15:52.277
Now, I want you

00:15:52.677 --> 00:15:54.877
to sketch the former Crown Prince

00:15:55.757 --> 00:15:57.598
just to help and protect him.

00:16:02.517 --> 00:16:03.997
Also all the people

00:16:05.078 --> 00:16:06.358
in the nation.

00:16:18.877 --> 00:16:20.277
So you didn't burn the painting,

00:16:20.757 --> 00:16:22.598
but traded it for the antidote.

00:16:24.598 --> 00:16:24.877
Yes.

00:16:25.438 --> 00:16:26.397
I couldn't let you die.

00:16:28.157 --> 00:16:29.677
With the parents' facial features,

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:32.517
he can sketch

00:16:32.797 --> 00:16:34.637
their offspring's face?

00:16:35.358 --> 00:16:36.118
Quite a skill!

00:16:37.198 --> 00:16:37.917
I thought

00:16:38.318 --> 00:16:39.637
he failed to draw money notes,

00:16:39.757 --> 00:16:40.757
so you wanted him dead.

00:16:41.637 --> 00:16:42.677
Be serious.

00:16:42.917 --> 00:16:43.397
So,

00:16:44.358 --> 00:16:46.037
the Emperor sent you here to find

00:16:46.157 --> 00:16:47.198
the former Crown Prince,

00:16:47.397 --> 00:16:49.198
but none of you know what he looks like,

00:16:49.992 --> 00:16:52.277
then you stole
the late Empress's portrait

00:16:52.277 --> 00:16:53.877
for the sketch.

00:16:55.118 --> 00:16:55.958
But you gave

00:16:56.037 --> 00:16:57.198
the late Empress's portrait

00:16:57.277 --> 00:16:58.118
to Grand Tutor Zhou.

00:16:58.478 --> 00:16:59.238
Then they must...

00:16:59.238 --> 00:16:59.997
Stop right there.

00:17:00.438 --> 00:17:02.558
He wanted the painting for the antidote.

00:17:02.718 --> 00:17:03.877
Otherwise, you'd have died.

00:17:05.877 --> 00:17:06.637
The Emperor

00:17:07.358 --> 00:17:08.078
gave you poison?

00:17:11.677 --> 00:17:12.437
Failed my mission,

00:17:13.278 --> 00:17:14.397
I've accepted my fate.

00:17:15.477 --> 00:17:16.838
He is so cruel.

00:17:17.896 --> 00:17:18.518
How dare you!

00:17:18.998 --> 00:17:19.798
I won't let you die.

00:17:20.328 --> 00:17:24.088
♪Night clouds blush crimson,
yet fingertips miss their touch♪

00:17:24.296 --> 00:17:26.815
♪Fear shatters tremors of the heart♪

00:17:28.127 --> 00:17:31.749
♪Like chains binding snow swans,
swirling yet confined♪

00:17:31.816 --> 00:17:33.760
♪Imprisoned within♪

00:17:34.437 --> 00:17:35.278
I vaguely remember

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.118
when I held you in my arms,

00:17:38.358 --> 00:17:39.598
you lost consciousness

00:17:40.278 --> 00:17:41.637
and your body turned cold...

00:17:43.758 --> 00:17:44.677
Stop right there.

00:17:45.318 --> 00:17:47.237
If Grand Tutor Zhou discovers

00:17:47.358 --> 00:17:48.877
that you harbor the former Crown...

00:17:49.237 --> 00:17:50.758
No former Crown Prince here.

00:17:52.197 --> 00:17:54.278
Every household has its secrets.

00:17:55.197 --> 00:17:57.118
The Xue family's loyalty to Hua Dynasty

00:17:57.758 --> 00:17:58.998
can be witnessed by heavens.

00:18:00.637 --> 00:18:01.197
Annoying.

00:18:01.637 --> 00:18:02.118
Get out.

00:18:03.318 --> 00:18:04.118
From now on,

00:18:04.518 --> 00:18:06.118
I'll find the former Crown Prince

00:18:06.437 --> 00:18:07.558
and the truth with you.

00:18:09.758 --> 00:18:10.798
Why would I trust you?

00:18:12.518 --> 00:18:13.437
If you can't find him,

00:18:13.917 --> 00:18:14.957
the Emperor will kill you.

00:18:15.598 --> 00:18:16.798
Now only by working together

00:18:16.917 --> 00:18:17.798
can we find him.

00:18:18.877 --> 00:18:20.477
I won't harm you either.

00:18:22.518 --> 00:18:23.758
(If he wants to harm me,)

00:18:24.157 --> 00:18:25.197
(he would never save me)

00:18:25.352 --> 00:18:26.437
(and invite trouble.)

00:18:30.717 --> 00:18:31.598
My men found out

00:18:32.078 --> 00:18:33.917
Grand Tutor Zhou caught Hua Biliang.

00:18:34.558 --> 00:18:37.000
Then he must've had
the portrait of the former Crown Prince.

00:18:37.197 --> 00:18:38.038
Go figure out a plan.

00:18:40.038 --> 00:18:40.518
Okay.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:50.998
Sir.

00:18:51.397 --> 00:18:52.798
Hua Biliang completed the portrait.

00:18:56.397 --> 00:18:57.437
Kill him.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.157
Yes.

00:19:16.078 --> 00:19:16.717
What's wrong?

00:19:17.758 --> 00:19:18.237
Sir.

00:19:18.558 --> 00:19:20.118
Mr. Xue sent a dancing troupe

00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:21.237
to cause a scene outside.

00:19:21.957 --> 00:19:22.998
And Hua...

00:19:23.917 --> 00:19:24.477
(As expected,)

00:19:25.078 --> 00:19:26.558
(they caught Hua Biliang.)

00:19:28.838 --> 00:19:30.118
Mr. Xue, good day.

00:19:39.758 --> 00:19:41.437
Thanks to your antidote.

00:19:41.717 --> 00:19:43.318
My father has mostly recovered.

00:19:43.437 --> 00:19:45.118
I'm here to express my gratitude.

00:19:45.437 --> 00:19:46.998
Well, I brought a dance troupe

00:19:47.048 --> 00:19:48.278
to liven up your mansion.

00:19:48.677 --> 00:19:49.758
And some gifts.

00:19:50.118 --> 00:19:51.838
Please accept them.

00:19:55.758 --> 00:19:57.518
(My men found
Grand Tutor's secret chamber)

00:19:57.917 --> 00:19:59.038
(is in the Jing'an Bureau.)

00:20:22.717 --> 00:20:25.358
Since Lord Dingyuan
has mostly recovered,

00:20:28.237 --> 00:20:29.798
are you here

00:20:30.477 --> 00:20:32.717
to fulfill your promise?

00:20:33.032 --> 00:20:34.078
Tell me,

00:20:34.598 --> 00:20:36.518
what exactly did Lord Dingyuan tell you?

00:20:37.558 --> 00:20:37.998
Yes.

00:20:38.477 --> 00:20:40.637
I should tell you about this.

00:20:41.758 --> 00:20:42.477
This morning,

00:20:42.677 --> 00:20:43.957
when I went to my father,

00:20:44.157 --> 00:20:45.237
I got dragged

00:20:45.358 --> 00:20:46.838
by my sister-in-law to breakfast.

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:47.877
To be honest,

00:20:48.118 --> 00:20:49.637
the breakfast spread was impressive.

00:20:49.917 --> 00:20:51.677
Pancakes, handmade noodles,

00:20:51.877 --> 00:20:53.677
dumplings, sesame cakes,
and red bean buns.

00:20:53.998 --> 00:20:55.237
There are many varieties.

00:20:55.637 --> 00:20:57.197
I ate many buns

00:20:57.318 --> 00:20:58.118
and steamed rolls

00:20:58.157 --> 00:20:59.278
until I was stuffed.

00:20:59.358 --> 00:21:00.197
Even now,

00:21:00.197 --> 00:21:01.437
I am so full that...

00:21:01.637 --> 00:21:02.397
Enough! Enough!

00:21:03.637 --> 00:21:05.397
Your Xue family

00:21:05.518 --> 00:21:06.397
is rich with food.

00:21:06.477 --> 00:21:07.437
I know it.

00:21:08.078 --> 00:21:10.078
Are you deliberately
avoiding the subject?

00:21:29.256 --> 00:21:29.957
Who's in there?

00:21:43.677 --> 00:21:44.157
Yes.

00:21:45.318 --> 00:21:47.477
But breakfast is important

00:21:47.598 --> 00:21:47.998
for us.

00:21:47.998 --> 00:21:48.677
Enough.

00:21:49.477 --> 00:21:50.358
Just tell me

00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:51.998
what Lord Dingyuan told you.

00:21:57.318 --> 00:21:58.157
Well,

00:21:58.358 --> 00:22:00.157
I went to my father

00:22:00.677 --> 00:22:01.477
and told him

00:22:01.477 --> 00:22:02.558
I had questions to ask

00:22:02.824 --> 00:22:04.078
and he must answer truthfully.

00:22:04.637 --> 00:22:06.957
And he was convinced

00:22:07.078 --> 00:22:07.798
by my solemnity.

00:22:08.397 --> 00:22:09.157
But then,

00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:14.237
he asked me,

00:22:15.477 --> 00:22:16.637
"You already know it?"

00:22:18.038 --> 00:22:20.038
After confirming no one was around,

00:22:20.477 --> 00:22:22.558
he confessed everything to me.

00:22:26.717 --> 00:22:28.397
What did he say?

00:22:29.157 --> 00:22:30.118
He said

00:22:31.078 --> 00:22:32.358
he was sorry to me.

00:22:33.157 --> 00:22:35.038
Why would he say that?

00:22:35.717 --> 00:22:36.558
He said

00:22:37.672 --> 00:22:40.278
I'm not the second kid
of the Xue family.

00:22:42.318 --> 00:22:43.358
Actually,

00:22:46.237 --> 00:22:47.118
I am

00:22:48.518 --> 00:22:49.838
the third kid.

00:22:50.677 --> 00:22:52.237
My younger sister and I are twins,

00:22:52.437 --> 00:22:54.838
but he didn't want her
to be the elder sibling,

00:22:55.197 --> 00:22:56.917
so he made me the older brother.

00:22:57.237 --> 00:22:57.877
Never thought

00:22:58.318 --> 00:22:59.877
I've endured my sister's bullying,

00:23:00.118 --> 00:23:01.477
and he felt so sorry.

00:23:02.358 --> 00:23:02.998
Xue Hexu!

00:23:03.272 --> 00:23:04.397
How dare you fool me!

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.118
Sir.

00:23:14.397 --> 00:23:15.598
Wait here.

00:23:15.798 --> 00:23:17.197
I have things to handle.

00:24:08.838 --> 00:24:10.477
Why do you come and go like a shadow?

00:24:11.437 --> 00:24:12.038
Found it?

00:24:12.677 --> 00:24:13.957
I saw a painting,

00:24:14.558 --> 00:24:15.637
but was nearly discovered.

00:24:16.038 --> 00:24:17.437
I need to go there again.

00:24:18.237 --> 00:24:18.798
Perhaps

00:24:19.598 --> 00:24:20.677
we should retreat for now.

00:24:21.758 --> 00:24:22.798
Those petty guards

00:24:22.917 --> 00:24:24.038
are no match for me.

00:24:24.677 --> 00:24:25.480
I must retrieve it

00:24:26.038 --> 00:24:26.877
no matter what.

00:24:28.677 --> 00:24:29.118
Fine.

00:24:29.397 --> 00:24:30.118
You're capable.

00:24:30.798 --> 00:24:31.758
But be cautious.

00:24:32.957 --> 00:24:33.477
You go first.

00:24:33.677 --> 00:24:34.637
I'll hold them up.

00:24:47.358 --> 00:24:47.798
I...

00:24:49.197 --> 00:24:49.798
Xue Hexu!

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.677
You've been talking nonsense here,

00:24:52.677 --> 00:24:54.078
holding me up.

00:24:54.637 --> 00:24:55.957
What are you up to?

00:24:56.558 --> 00:24:57.358
Confess now.

00:24:57.798 --> 00:24:58.998
Sir, you misunderstood me.

00:24:59.437 --> 00:25:00.998
We were having a pleasant conversation.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.118
You tried to lure me away
and steal my stuff.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.677
You villain!

00:25:07.477 --> 00:25:07.998
Sir.

00:25:08.677 --> 00:25:10.237
Ever since I came here,

00:25:10.318 --> 00:25:11.358
I've been right here.

00:25:13.278 --> 00:25:14.477
Do you mean

00:25:14.758 --> 00:25:15.717
you lost

00:25:16.278 --> 00:25:17.157
something valuable?

00:25:19.437 --> 00:25:20.798
Not really.

00:25:21.917 --> 00:25:23.197
But there was an intruder.

00:25:25.237 --> 00:25:25.758
Sir.

00:25:26.917 --> 00:25:27.318
Sir.

00:25:27.848 --> 00:25:29.544
The dance troupe is
making a scene again.

00:25:29.637 --> 00:25:30.758
They claim Mr. Xue asked

00:25:30.877 --> 00:25:32.157
them to do it every two hours

00:25:32.318 --> 00:25:32.838
until

00:25:33.358 --> 00:25:34.917
Mr. Xue settles their payment.

00:25:37.838 --> 00:25:38.798
Yes, yes.

00:25:39.558 --> 00:25:41.397
I forgot to pay them.

00:25:42.318 --> 00:25:43.677
With so many people watching,

00:25:43.677 --> 00:25:45.717
if I don't pay them, it'll be...

00:25:55.917 --> 00:25:57.758
Convey my gratitude to Lord Dingyuan.

00:25:57.917 --> 00:25:58.477
However,

00:25:59.078 --> 00:26:00.477
let me remind you.

00:26:01.838 --> 00:26:03.758
Don't be fooled by someone

00:26:03.998 --> 00:26:05.518
cleverer than you

00:26:05.677 --> 00:26:06.877
even without realizing it.

00:26:48.157 --> 00:26:48.877
Greetings.

00:26:51.798 --> 00:26:52.758
Feng Zuoren.

00:26:53.477 --> 00:26:54.838
How dare you show up here?

00:26:55.637 --> 00:26:57.397
I sent the Chief
of the Imperial Household

00:26:57.518 --> 00:26:59.318
to teach you a lesson.

00:26:59.917 --> 00:27:00.677
Never expected

00:27:00.957 --> 00:27:02.998
you'd repay me with a suicide attempt,

00:27:03.318 --> 00:27:05.078
cause a scene,

00:27:05.598 --> 00:27:07.518
and even involve an outsider
to save your life.

00:27:08.168 --> 00:27:08.957
You've

00:27:09.637 --> 00:27:10.758
embarrassed me.

00:27:11.278 --> 00:27:12.157
I'm sorry.

00:27:12.998 --> 00:27:14.197
The Deadly Poison you gave me

00:27:14.437 --> 00:27:16.197
was from the Jing'an Bureau.

00:27:16.758 --> 00:27:17.518
It's not potent.

00:27:17.877 --> 00:27:18.877
Which reveals

00:27:19.078 --> 00:27:21.078
the Jing'an Bureau's poisons
are not effective.

00:27:21.518 --> 00:27:22.278
This matters.

00:27:22.558 --> 00:27:23.518
Hope you can check them.

00:27:24.437 --> 00:27:25.157
You are here

00:27:25.518 --> 00:27:27.877
to complain against the Jing'an Bureau?

00:27:28.358 --> 00:27:29.397
I've finally obtained

00:27:29.598 --> 00:27:31.358
a portrait of the former Crown Prince.

00:27:51.318 --> 00:27:52.798
Look at him.

00:27:53.998 --> 00:27:55.157
Nothing but

00:27:55.157 --> 00:27:57.477
a wretched fugitive.

00:27:58.237 --> 00:28:00.558
Your Majesty, please allow me

00:28:00.838 --> 00:28:01.558
to catch this man.

00:28:02.038 --> 00:28:03.397
Do not disappoint me again.

00:28:04.477 --> 00:28:04.957
Leave!

00:28:20.232 --> 00:28:21.917
(They asked me to come
to the main hall.)

00:28:21.917 --> 00:28:23.278
(What are they up to?)

00:28:24.118 --> 00:28:25.096
(Just play along then.)
