WEBVTT

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.340
But why does she look so familiar?

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.450
No matter how I look at her,
she reminds me of someone.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.950
(Searching for a missing person)

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.920
Don't tell me, Madam Jung?

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.960
No, that's impossible.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.730
How can a stranger look so identical?
They're not even twins.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.560
I'll just have to confirm it myself.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.740
Yeon Ah.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.070
Can I see you right now?

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.250
Gosh, it's been forever, Manager Gong.
How have you been?

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.980
So much has happened.
Where would I even begin?

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.150
Ms. Kyung Chae had her engagement party
a few days ago.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.860
With Lawyer Kim Sun Jae.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.130
Oh, really?

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.830
Ms. Kyung Chae had a really rough time...

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.430
because of Madam Jung, the new madam.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.230
And so have I, for that matter.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.170
I'm telling you,
I was almost thrown out of the house.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.010
After that woman moved into the house,
she's made life miserable for everyone.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.180
Gosh.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.850
Come on, she's still the chairman's wife.
Isn't calling her "that woman" a bit much?

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.780
What's the harm
in talking behind her back?

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.760
Right. You said you found your sister
who went missing, didn't you?

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.660
I seem to recall hearing she's living
somewhere out of town.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.390
Wait, why the sudden question
about my sister?

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.860
I'll get straight to the point.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.400
It's because your sister
looks a lot like that woman.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.400
(Searching for a missing person)

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.570
That's ridiculous!

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.840
Are you saying the chairman's wife
is my sister?

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.110
We'll know for sure
once we see for ourselves.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.180
Let me meet your sister.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.150
I don't understand your sudden change,
Manager Gong.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.620
One second.
I really have to use the restroom.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.330
Where are you right now, Sul Hee?

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.200
The company?

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.570
No, I just stepped out to find
Chairman Min Doo Sik.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.570
What's wrong?

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.880
Manager Gong just came to see me
and asked if you were Baek Sul Hee.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.650
She says she has to meet you
to confirm it.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.350
What are you talking about?

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.720
How on earth would she know that?

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.220
When delivering side dishes to the house,

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.220
I gave her one of the flyers
that was looking for you.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.660
I asked her to call me if she saw a match.
I guess she kept it all this time.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.300
Yeon Ah, listen to me very carefully.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.440
Tell Manager Gong you lost touch with me
after that,

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.040
and do whatever it takes
to take that flyer from her.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.870
If that's gone, everything will be fine.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.840
You know what I mean, right?

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.610
Yes, I get it.
I'll make sure to take it from her.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:02.950
Seriously.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.720
(Chunbokjib Black Goat)

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.230
What do we do?
It's true that I met my sister,

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.270
but we lost touch again right after that,
and I haven't heard from her since.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.400
And you expect me to believe that?

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.470
Just give that to me. I'll throw it away.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.680
You're being very suspicious, Yeon Ah.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.180
This isn't some scheme you cooked up
with your sister, is it?

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.880
What? Now I've heard everything.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.890
If your sister is Baek Sul Hee,
as it says here,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.320
and she entered the chairman's house
pretending to be someone else,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.960
that's a pretty big deal.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.990
Anyway, I'll handle this myself.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:41.960
Where are you going?

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.200
I'm going to the company
to tell Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.700
She's the one who needs to know
if that woman is deceiving everyone.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.610
Sul Hee, what am I going to do?

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.050
What happened?

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.020
Manager Gong took the flyer
to the company.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.680
She said she'll show it to Min Kyung Chae.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.720
This is driving me crazy.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.920
Okay. I'm on my way to the company now.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.330
Taxi!

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.910
(Mingang Distribution)

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.330
She's not at her desk. Where did she go?

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.640
Where are you now?

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.310
I'm in the chairman's office.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.080
Manager Gong? What brings you here?

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.550
There's something
you must see, Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.680
- I've brought something very important.
- What is it?

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.650
It's about Madam Jung.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.590
Anyway, you need to see this
with your own eyes.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.630
I'm out of the office right now,
so it might be a while.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.860
That's all right. I'll wait.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.750
(Mi So's Mom)

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.360
What on earth? He should've taken
his phone to the meeting.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.260
What am I, his gofer?
Do I have to answer his calls for him too?

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:58.930
Gosh.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.910
Hello?

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.540
Isn't this
Director Moon Tae Kyung's phone?

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.940
Yes, it is. He's in a meeting
and left his phone behind,

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.280
so I'm answering for him.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.010
Hey...

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.820
What? How rude!

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:19.980
(Mi So's Mom)

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.020
What was that about?

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.390
Wait, is he seeing a married woman?

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.260
That voice sounds so familiar, though.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.730
Sir, can you please speed up a little?

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.440
Come on...

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.610
Yes, Ms. Ja Kyung.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:48.910
Where are you?

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.550
- You didn't even make lunch.
- Is that why you called?

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.750
Just order in.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.290
I'm out doing something important.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.090
Oh, my. What is with this attitude?

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.990
Are you getting an attitude
with me right now?

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.270
And why did you leave this half-cleaned?

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.370
The living room is a total mess.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.940
Anyway, I can't go back right now,
so just order something for yourself.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.710
Or just skip a meal for once.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.070
You're always going on
about your diet anyway.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.080
What did you just say? How dare you!

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.050
This is insubordination, isn't it?
A coup d'etat of sorts.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.550
It seems you've forgotten your place.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:26.880
Excuse me?

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.220
If you don't want to get fired,
you'll come back and serve lunch.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.720
You wouldn't dare talk back to Kyung Chae.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.430
Do I look like a pushover to you?

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.000
You'd better get back here now.
If you want a bigger problem, be my guest!

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.300
Unbelievable. Gosh.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.740
Where should I leave this?

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.410
(Searching for a missing person)

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.920
She'll see it if I leave it here.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.990
My goodness.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.300
Manager Gong? What's she doing here?

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.040
(Searching for a missing person)

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.520
What's this? Why is this here?

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.460
Did Manager Gong leave this here?

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.300
Wait a second.
Why didn't I think of this before?

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.800
With this, I can bury my past
and expose Baek Sul Hee's true identity.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.270
(Searching for a missing person)

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.310

it's game over.

(Mingang Distribution)

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.820
Baek Sul Hee.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:08.150
You really should have lived a clean life.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.660
How could this have possibly found its way
back into my hands?

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:16.960
Give that to me right now!

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.560
What, am I crazy?
You think I'd just hand this over?

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.400
- Give it to me!
- Let go!

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.770
You're finished, Baek Sul Hee.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.940
I'm going to expose everything
about you with this.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.810
I shouldn't have given this to you easily
the first time I had it.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.510
But I'm lucky
I managed to get it back, right?

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.520
- Give it to me! Please!
- Get off me!

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.690
Darn it.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:47.060
(Mingang Distribution)

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:58.140
You think I'll go down alone?
If my identity is exposed,

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.710
then your past with me gets exposed too.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.740
I'm so scared.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:04.410
That's what you're banking on, isn't it?

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.640
Our college friends who know about us
living together in the past...

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.150
and all your other so-called friends.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:12.050
Go on. Call them up right now.
Ask them to be your witnesses.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.620
Why are you being like this
all of a sudden?

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.950
Everyone has a price.
Did you learn nothing from your daughter?

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.620
Your daughter's friend, whom you trusted.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.060
And the cafe owner your daughter
worked for. What happened to them?

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.030
They were paid off.
What makes you think I can't do it again?

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.730
How can you say something like that?
And you still call yourself her father?

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.100
I'm not her father!

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.540
I never wanted her to be born
in the first place.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:36.210
The reason I put up with you until now
is the slush fund ledger you stole.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:40.510
But now that Min Doo Sik is gone,
all it takes is this, and it's game over.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.680
You think someone like Min Kyung Chae
will see this and just let it slide?

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.620
You're just
the snack bar lady on this flyer.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.120
That's all you'll ever be.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.160
Who do you think you are,

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.060
running around trying to get revenge
for your daughter?

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.230
Fine.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:02.430
Then I guess I'll just have to make
Min Se Ri end up like my Mi So.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.370
Se Ri is the kind of girl who would
even pretend to die if I told her to.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.610
If something were to happen to Se Ri,
do you think Min Kyung Chae would be okay?

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.810
No, she'll lose her mind.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.480
If she sees her own child get hurt right
in front of her,

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.410
what mother wouldn't lose her mind?"

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.150
Cut the pathetic threats!

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.180
You think you'd really do that,
Baek Sul Hee?

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:24.160
You're not cruel enough to sacrifice Se Ri
just to save your own skin.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.260
What wouldn't I do to survive?
What is Se Ri to me, anyway?

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.000
I'll make you pay in the exact same way.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.100
I'll put Se Ri
right where Mi So had her accident.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:42.240
Think about it carefully.
Min Kyung Chae is Se Ri's birth mother.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.110
If something happens to her child,

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.640
no mother in the world would be okay.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:48.880
If Min Kyung Chae falls apart,

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:52.650
then your dreams will be shattered
along with her.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.820
Do you get it now?

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.000
What are you two doing here?

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:09.870
Nothing at all.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.370
I came to give you a report,
but you weren't in.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:19.880
So?

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.080
How was my father?

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.010
He seemed to be doing well.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.220
Is that so?

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.050
I only went to tell him of the engagement.

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:32.860
There was no other reason,
so don't read too much into it.

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.830
Now you need to properly prepare
to take over the chairmanship.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:38.860
I should.

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.600
I need to drop "acting" from my title

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.700
so Mingang Distribution
can finally be all mine.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.240
By the way,

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:50.770
I think we'll have to move
the chairman soon.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:52.140
Move him?

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.450
Somewhere further away,
more cut off from the world.

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.780
A place where absolutely no one
can find him.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.620
Why, all of a sudden?

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.580
The current place seems secure enough.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.250
He seems...

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.720
to want Lucia to find him.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:07.930
Who's looking for whom?

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.300
He's hopelessly delusional.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.840
She should have seen the flyer by now,
so why hasn't she called?

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.990
Why didn't you call me?

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:37.590
You saw what was on your desk, didn't you?

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.190
There was nothing on my desk.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:41.930
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.590
A missing person flyer?

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.430
Anyway, let's talk more at home later.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:56.140
So you're saying
that woman on the flyer is Lucia?

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.440
Definitely.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.840
You know I'm good with faces, right?

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.080
I wonder who got rid of the flyer.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.980
We can figure that out tomorrow.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.990
And her real name is Baek Sul Hee?

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:11.660
Yes. It said she was the owner
of Miso Snack Bar.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.020
Miso Snack Bar?

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.700
These people killed my daughter.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:22.000
My innocent daughter died for no reason!

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.800
Tell them what you did.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.440
Tell them so the whole world knows!

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.610
Beg for my Mi So's forgiveness!

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:35.510
Beg and say you're sorry!

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:40.550
Bring back my daughter!
You should beg a thousand times!

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.450
Plead and beg!

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:45.890
Right. That woman.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.130
Now I remember.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.100
No way...

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.300
It was her?

00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:00.400
Mom, I had this cake today,
and it was so delicious.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.010
- Really? What kind of cake was it?
- Cheesecake.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.410
- Cheesecake?
- I wish you could've had some with me...

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.480
If you really are that woman...

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:12.420
If all you're doing for my daughter
is a lie and just an act...

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.950
If you're using my daughter as a pawn
to get revenge for your own daughter,

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.020
I'll never forgive you.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.240
What are you staring at?

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.370
It's nothing.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:36.570
By the way,

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.740
you still haven't found Dad?

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:40.880
Are you sure you're even looking for him?

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.950
Or what?

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.080
What would I gain by lying to you?

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:48.290
If you can't handle it, just stop.
I'll look for him myself.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.890
You never know.
I might find him in no time.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.690
I'm speaking as the acting chairman.
Stay out of it.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.990
Don't do anything
I haven't asked you to do.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.200
Your authority as acting chairman
applies to company business,

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:01.000
but this is about our dad.
It's a family matter.

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:02.070
Regardless,

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.540
staying out of this is the best way
to help yourself and our father.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:11.380
Just where on earth could he be?

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:18.850
Even with all this, she's still hung up
on that woman acting like Se Ri's mother.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.520
Maybe she does have
a strange connection with Se Ri.

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:32.200
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.130
You wanted to see me?

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.770
Did you happen to see a flyer
on my desk yesterday?

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:42.370
A flyer?

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.840
I don't think so.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.110
Why? Was it important?

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:48.410
No, never mind.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.610
I guess the cleaning crew
must have thrown it away.

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:54.050
Anyway, I need you
to look into someone for me.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:55.920
Who?

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.390
Baek Sul Hee.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:01.530
Lawyer Kim, do you remember her?

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.060
The one who said her daughter
was dead because of Se Ri,

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.060
made a scene at our new business launch,

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.270
and then suddenly disappeared.

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.870
Yes, I remember her.

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:14.270
- Why bring her up all of a sudden?
- You don't need to know that.

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:16.840
Find out whether she's still missing,

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.040
or if she's been found.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.240
If she hasn't been found,
find out if she's alive or dead.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.210
And if it's neither of those,

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:27.790
find out if she's hiding her identity
and living as someone else.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:29.990
I want you to find out
every single detail.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.230
You could at least knock.
Have you no basic courtesy?

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:43.000
Forget about knocking.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.200
Do you have any idea
what orders I just got?

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.340
I've been ordered to find out
who you really are.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.940
Whether Baek Sul Hee is dead or alive.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.310
And if she's alive,
where she is and what she's doing.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.410
What are you talking about?

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.350
Don't tell me Min Kyung Chae...

00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:00.180
This is all because your sister
handed out those flyers.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.790
That's how we ended up in this mess!

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:06.390
You figured out who I was from that flyer.
Don't you remember?

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.590
You were gloating about it back then.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:09.960
And now you're complaining?

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:11.400
What?

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.230
(Mingang Distribution)

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.700
It's not my problem. You figure it out.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.700
You're good at that sort of thing,
aren't you?

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.640
Forging things, setting traps,
and plotting.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:21.870
Have you lost your mind?

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:23.310
Have you gone crazy?

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:26.540
One wrong move,
and your cover will be blown.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:30.650
Exactly. So it's your job
to make sure I'm not caught.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.580
I have Se Ri in the palm of my hand,

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.090
and she is
Min Kyung Chae's biggest weakness.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.920
So, who do you think will come out on top?

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.230
So you'll use Min Se Ri as a hostage
until the very end, is that it?

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:46.000
So, like I said, you handle it.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.560
I'll be counting on you.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:49.670
Darn it.

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:00.410
She is unbelievable.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.680
If anything happens to Min Se Ri,
Min Kyung Chae will be shattered.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.550
What if she tries to ruin Min Se Ri...

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.920
just because I exposed her identity?

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.640
(Chunbokjib Black Goat)

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:33.080
What a mess.
Why did I give Manager Gong that flyer?

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:37.710
I just hope nothing goes wrong.
I'm so worried.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.120
Why are you muttering
to yourself like that?

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:42.950
Do you have something on your mind?

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.460
No. It's nothing.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.160
I haven't seen Mr. Oh around at all today.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:52.800
Who knows?
Probably off cheating on me somewhere.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:57.530
He got all spruced up this morning
and left looking like a playboy.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.870
I'm sure he just has somewhere important
to be.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.170
Important, my foot.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.680
I'll be lucky if he's not out there
causing trouble.

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:06.210
Unbelievable.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:15.520
With this money, follow your instincts
and pick some good stocks for me.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.390
Oh, my. Is this cash?

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.860
Pan Sool, you're so old-school.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.930
Who even carries around
wads of cash like this?

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:29.400
I do all my business
with old-fashioned, cold, hard cash.

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:33.240
We meet, look each other in the eye,
and slam down the cash.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.540
Anyway, please pick the stocks
that will boom.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.940
I'm counting on you to hit it big for me.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:43.150
That's not a problem.
That happens to be my specialty.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.350
I'm putting all my trust in you, Madam.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:48.150
I'm putting all my faith in you, Stella.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.220
Stella, you are BCI.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:51.490
A bird that's crazy for investing.

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:56.390
Or GIS, the Goddess of Investing, Stella.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:59.500
Of course.
You lose nothing by trusting me.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.470
Since you trust me, go all in.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:05.100
Then with my latest intel and expertise,

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:09.670
I'll find the best stocks
and make you a stock market tycoon.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:12.380
It's not like we're strangers, right?

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:17.010
We're not family, and we're not friends,

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:18.680
but you're saying we're not strangers?

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:20.520
Of course. They say
even a chance encounter...

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.790
means you're meant to be.

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:25.690
Compared to that,
our connection is rock solid.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.660
That killer wink.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.130
Hold on a second.

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:35.630
I almost forgot.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.120
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.450
- Okay, thank you.
- Thanks.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.320
Hello?

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.030
It's Kim Sun Jae. You remember me, right?

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.500
If you don't want to see
your sister get hurt,

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.330
meet me at Malevich
by the Mucheon Roundabout right now.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.770
And before you come, get the documents
I'm about to text you a list of.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:13.840
Wait, what do you need documents for?

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.710
Your sister has been missing
for a long time,

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:18.880
so she's likely been
legally declared dead.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.310
I need to confirm that,
so no more questions. Just do as I say.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:23.750
Hey...

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.550
What in the world is he talking about?

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.120
My sister is alive and well.
How can she be declared dead?

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:33.120
Is he planning on hurting my sister again?

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.360
Sul Hee, I'm about to go meet Kim Sun Jae.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:43.470
You are? What did he say?

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:46.500
He told me to come right away
if I don't want to see you get hurt.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:50.940
He said you were dead or something,
and told me to bring him some documents.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.910
Don't worry, Yeon Ah.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.950
From now on, he's going to be the one
hiding my identity for me.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.620
What's this?

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.090
See for yourself.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:13.700
This is...

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.530
It turned out Baek Sul Hee is dead.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.670
Her sole living family member
held a funeral...

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:21.910
and filed a death certificate.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.110
Is that right?

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.880
It was issued by a government agency,
so there's no way it's a fake.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.010
I got it directly
from the family member myself.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.280
Her younger sister,
the only family she has left,

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.090
asked me who I was to be digging
into her dead sister's past.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.360
So, how did you handle her?

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.090
I gave her a plausible story. Don't worry.

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:45.760
But it's a good thing that woman
is out of the picture, isn't it?

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.570
It would've been a bit unsettling
if she were still alive.

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.330
But now it's been cleanly resolved.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.870
I suppose you're right.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.240
All right, you can go now.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:57.710
Okay.

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:11.490
(Name: Baek Sul Hee
Date of Death: July 24, 2025)

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.560
You convinced Min Kyung Chae, didn't you?

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.130
She won't suspect me again, will she?

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.270
Yes. Happy now?

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:27.100
I jump at your command,

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.710
I cover for you when your identity
is about to be exposed,

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.540
and I have to lie to Min Kyung Chae
just to save your skin.

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:35.010
You must be loving this.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.510
I bet you're feeling on top of the world.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.480
I can't complain.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.590
You'll be doing a lot more of what I say
from now on.

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:47.360
This is just the beginning,

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:49.460
so don't let it wound your pride.

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:51.460
Baek Sul Hee.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.400
I may have saved you this time,

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:58.000
but next time, I'll take you down myself.
Just you wait.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:06.940
I'll see myself out.

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:13.420
(Mingang Distribution)

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:23.590
No, wait.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.130
Oh, I didn’t think of that!

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:29.070
A way to get them both kicked out
of Mingang at the same time.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.360
I've got it.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:03.770
Let me go! Get off me!

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:05.270
Let go!

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.000
Let me go, you punks!

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:14.910
Are we in the clear now?

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:19.650
Judging by Kim Sun Jae's reaction,
I'm sure he handled it on his end.

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.450
What a relief.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:26.920
I was worried he might change his mind
and expose you.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.460
He's too calculating for that.
It won't happen.

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:33.530
Still, I couldn't help but feel
a little anxious myself.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.030
We're past that hurdle now.

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:39.170
So now all we have to do is find
Chairman Min Doo Sik.

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:44.110
(CEO Jung Lucia)

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.580
What's wrong? What is it?

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:03.230
Lucia, it's me.
I need you to come and save me.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.000
These guys have been dragging me
all over the place.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:08.600
Now they're taking me to the Merry Motel
at the Mucheon intersection.

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:11.630
I'm texting you while they're not looking.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.500
Please hurry and get me out of here.

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:28.990
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.140
You think you can get away with this?

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:48.040
What kind of person does a thing so vile
without even batting an eye?

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.340
It's Baek Sul Hee, isn't it?
Lucia's an impostor, isn't she?

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:53.010
I have a bad feeling about this.
But we still have to check, right?

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.410
If anything goes wrong, I'll buy you time.

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:57.210
Run and call the police.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.050
She's not coming for you.
Do you get it now?

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.350
What are you talking about?

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.190
