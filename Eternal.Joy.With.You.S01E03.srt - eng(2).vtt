=Eternal Joy With You=
=Episode 3=

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.910
How dare you hit me?

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.070
You libertine!

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.910
Why wouldn't I dare?

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.710
Libertine?

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.820
I have no interest in you.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.200
I don't care if you're the Commander,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.640
or someone unrelated to me,

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.070
you must respect me.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:55.640
You know me?

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.150
People say

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.840
you're the most scheming woman
who currys favor with the powerful.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.230
Don't you know your reputation
precedes you?

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.040
I can't control what people say,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.040
and I don't care.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.000
But if you see me that way,

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.210
it means you're no different

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.590
from those petty people who gossip.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.280
Do you believe I'll kill you right now?

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.920
I've already died once.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.920
I fear nothing.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.350
The night is deep.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.040
Commander, if there's nothing else,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.990
you may leave.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.280
By the way, Commander Pei,

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.000
I hope we can go our separate ways

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.350
from now on.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.790
If you don't trouble me,

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.430
I won't ruin your plans.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.120
Commander, let me teach her a lesson.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.150
She's far too arrogant.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.510
How dare she insult you like that?

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.480
And...

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.990
She even said you're incapable.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.050
Little does she know
you've already recovered.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.240
- I'll just...
- Just what?

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.200
Let's go back.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.270
Commander.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.780
(Marquis's Mansion in Yan City)

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.870
The ground is slippery.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.030
Lady Cui, please be careful.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.910
You're so meticulous.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.470
You're truly endearing.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.860
(Marquis's Mansion in Yan City)

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.000
From now on, our family

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.520
will rely on your diligence.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.150
You look like such a good person.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.680
Finally, someone can share my burdens.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.470
I look forward to your guidance,
Wanning.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.120
Hmm.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.800
I'll make sure to guide you well.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.500
Let's go.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.380
(Marquis's Mansion in Yan City)

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.000
(In the previous life,
you all trampled me like mud.)

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.630
(In this lifetime,)

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.750
(I'll return it exactly as it was.)

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.750
Young Master Ping is so seriously ill.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.960
It must be due to someone's negligence.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.750
Qingqing, what do you mean by that?

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.000
I don't quite understand.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.270
Forget it.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.800
Since you think I can't take care
of Ping properly,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.240
then let's do this.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.470
Qingqing,

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.750
why not help me share this burden?

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.150
I believe you can take good care of him.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.870
What do you think, Qingqing?

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.470
I'm willing to share this burden.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.200
Mother,

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.150
see, Qingqing has agreed.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.630
Please just agree to it.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.870
What matters most now is Ping.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.750
No matter who it is,

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.470
you must take good care of him.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.550
Yes.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.870
I'll go prepare the medicine.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.320
Go ahead.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.470
Bai Qingqing,

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.390
you looked so smug just now.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.390
You can't wait for her
to find out right now

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.510
that Ping is your child.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.160
Madam, I was wrong.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.040
Enough, Mother.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.800
Qingqing is new here.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.360
Please don't blame her.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.400
Forget it.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.520
Bai Qingqing,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.430
you must take good care
of my precious grandson.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.430
If anything happens to him,

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.310
I will hold you accountable.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.920
Yes, Madam.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.920
My Lady, the fish has taken the bait

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.390
and is biting firmly.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.160
It's a pity you're too kind-hearted.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.480
You can't just ignore Cui Qingping.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.920
Now our young master

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.480
can't even be found.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.360
Still no news from the midwife?

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.310
We need to speed things up.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.480
Let's go.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.580
Deliver the medicine first.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.840
Hmm.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.120
You lowly servants!

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.360
Open your eyes and see clearly.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.040
I'm someone close to the Marquis.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.680
How dare you ignore me!

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.840
Miss, I'm so sorry.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.990
I was in a hurry and accidentally
bumped into you.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.160
I didn't mean to.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.000
You insolent servants!

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.870
When I officially marry into the family,

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.070
I'll have you all sold off.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.000
Wanning,

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.190
what brings you here?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.600
Qingqing, you're quite authoritative.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.280
The servants were being disrespectful.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.190
I was just teaching them a lesson
for you.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.950
Thank you so much.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.870
You're welcome.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:04.680
You two may leave now.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.750
Yes.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.440
This is the medicine
I specially prepared for Ping.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.750
Its effect is remarkable.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.240
What?

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.800
Lady Cui has specifically instructed

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.870
that no one

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:17.920
is allowed in here,

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.800
especially you.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.270
Me?

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.520
Yes.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.910
Fine.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.310
In this case, I won't enter.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.360
But make sure

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.800
you give this medicine to Ping.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.920
Wanning, rest assured.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.600
(Xu Wanning,)

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.000
(don't think I don't know
your intentions.)

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.210
(This medicine)

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.680
(is meant to harm my child.)

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.030
(Sure enough.)

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.270
(Evil minds always think the worst.)

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.590
Xu Wanning,

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.800
how dare you!

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.160
You dare to harm my precious grandson.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.510
Mother, what do you mean by this?

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.390
Stop playing dumb.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.870
What medicine did you give Ping?

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.390
He was unconscious for half a day.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.160
Madam Xu insisted I give this medicine

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.630
to Young Master Ping.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.190
But I didn't expect

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.310
this medicine would...

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:21.680
Qingqing,

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.940
are you so certain

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.560
that my medicine harmed Ping?

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.560
If you're falsely accusing me,

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.580
what crime should that be?

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.510
If it wasn't your medicine
that caused it,

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.390
I will kowtow my way to you

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.360
and apologize.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.120
Fine.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.270
Remember your words.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.880
Hongmei,

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.240
has Young Master Ping arrived yet?

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.430
Young Master Ping is here.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.640
My...

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.240
Young Master Ping,

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.630
why are you up?

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.830
Ping.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.360
Grandmother.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.720
Tell me,

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.390
was it her who made you
take the medicine?

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.520
Hmm.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.920
Xu Wanning,

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.510
what else do you have to say?

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.040
Guards!

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:01.630
Prepare the punishment.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.920
Who dares?

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.560
Mother,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.440
you haven't even figured it out yet.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.560
Don't rush it.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.320
Ping,

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.750
what medicine did I give you?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.290
Explain it clearly to everyone.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.070
Mother told me to smell this often,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.590
saying it would help with my illness.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:24.830
Take a closer look

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.950
and see if Ping's condition
has improved.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.180
Though this scented sachet

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.000
makes Ping drowsy,

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.120
it is indeed the best medicine
for the Rash.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.750
It does no harm to the body.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:39.990
Mother,

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:41.790
Ping is my child.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.390
How could I ever harm him?

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.080
You all believe Qingqing's nonsense,

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.840
and throw accusations at me.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.150
It truly breaks my heart.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.440
Enough, stop putting on this act.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.480
This medicine is meant
to harm Young Master Ping.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.360
I kindly took you into the Mansion.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.360
Yet you have repeatedly disrespected me.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.750
I held back from punishing you
out of respect for Yunfeng.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.720
Do you think I am dead?

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.120
You...!

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.560
Forget it.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.200
Since you are a guest here,

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.080
I won't argue with you further.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.270
But Qingqing,

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.320
you must fulfill your promise.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.390
Kowtow your way to me

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:28.790
and apologize.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:30.470
You...!

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.750
If you refuse to kneel,

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.120
leave our at once.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:39.630
I mean what I say.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:50.960
I have disrespected you.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.320
Please forgive me.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.630
I have disrespected you.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.870
Please forgive me.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:04.790
(Bai Qingqing,)

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.940
(this is all what you owed me
in the previous life.)

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.200
(But this is far from enough.)

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.920
Get up.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.240
But remember this well.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.990
There is a clear distinction
between ranks.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.270
Here,

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:24.750
I am the superior,

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.070
and you are the inferior.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.160
Your face...

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.320
Your face...

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.960
In the previous life, you conspired
to ruin my beauty.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.320
In this life,

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.480
it's your turn to taste my suffering.

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:47.670
Don't rush it.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.320
This is just the beginning.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.180
(Marquis's Mansion in Yan City)

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.480
Yunfeng,

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.750
my face is about to be ruined.
What should I do?

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.560
It won't happen.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.050
We've already offered a generous reward
for a physician.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.240
There must be a renowned one

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.600
to cure you and Ping's illness.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.630
It's all Xu Wanning's doing.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.510
She harmed Ping and me.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.150
Could she have discovered something?

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.120
I always feel like

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:22.790
she has changed a lot lately.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.080
Impossible.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:25.510
For so many years,

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.240
we've covered our tracks perfectly.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.750
She couldn't possibly guess
Ping's true identity.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:32.110
Yunfeng,

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:33.870
I have a plan

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.750
to vent this anger.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.280
What is it?

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:38.960
Let's do this.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.720
(Huichun Pharmacy)
The notice seeking a physician

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.150
has been posted for several days now.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.320
The reward increases day by day.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.150
But no one dares to take it.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.110
Exactly.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.830
Everyone knows the Corpse Blossom Rash
is nearly impossible to cure.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.240
Who would risk their future

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.320
to take on such a task?

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:56.590
(Seeking a physician)
You might even get thrown out.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.560
Look.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:59.600
500 taels.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.550
It's already 500 taels.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:01.670
Yes.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.680
Commander,

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.790
this is all the information

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.390
about Xu Wanning over the years

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:12.380
in the Marquis's Mansion.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:16.630
OK.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:28.300
(Notice)

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.160
Strange.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.790
Madam Cui paid me to take the notice.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.480
But someone else has already taken it.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:35.670
What's going on here?

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:37.000
The Lord said

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.390
some unclean things have entered
the house recently.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.270
He wants to invite a master
to perform a ritual

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.370
and dispel the bad energy.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.120
Then we'd better

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.840
watch this play closely.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.030
Master, please be gentle.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.120
Our courtyard was just cleaned.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.750
How dare you

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.390
be so rude to the Madam!

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:06.900
Darn it!

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.370
The Master is exorcising evil spirits.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:09.490
Why are you causing trouble?

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.210
Exorcising evil spirits?

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:15.630
Yunfeng, do you mean

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.510
the Master said the evil spirits
are on me?

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.550
Wanning, I don't know either.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.870
Master.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.870
Heaven and earth hold righteous energy.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.600
All things take shape in chaos.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.360
Madam Cui harbors evil spirits
within her.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.670
They must be expelled quickly.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.000
Otherwise, the household will be
in turmoil

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:35.720
and her life may even be at risk.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.200
Alas.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.840
Household in turmoil, life at risk.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.720
Is it that serious?

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.120
Then, Master,

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.510
how will you exorcise
these evil spirits?

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.510
Follow heaven's will,
and deliver three lashes.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.080
The first lash drives away misfortune.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.480
The second lash banishes ghosts.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.120
The third lash expels demons.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.550
Only then can the evil spirits
be exorcised.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.960
(In this lifetime,)

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.870
(I won't let you bully me anymore.)

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:03.910
(You liar,)

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.480
(I've already uncovered
your true nature.)

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.750
Will three lashes be enough?

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.200
Everyone in the household

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.550
must whip you,

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.550
or the evil spirits can't be exorcised

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.150
and will harm everyone.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.870
They

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.480
must all whip me?

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.320
Wait for me.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.680
Hey.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.240
What's happening?

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.610
The Cui Family is exorcising evil spirits.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.480
I heard the evil spirits

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.200
possess the Madam, Xu Wanning.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:40.550
You go and see the fun.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:45.790
Commander.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.720
You investigate the Hongzhen Incense.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.480
I'll head to the Marquis's Mansion.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.960
Understood.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.700
(Fortunately, I've made arrangements
in advance)

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.120
(to let someone spread the word.)

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.440
(I want to see with my own eyes)

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.270
(the Madame of the Marquis's Mansion)

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.770
(will soon become the laughingstock
of the entire city.)

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:06.960
Master,

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.320
must it be done?

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:09.840
Sure.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:11.120
Absolutely.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.600
Qingqing, do you also think so?

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.040
Wanning,

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.240
since the Master says the evil spirits
are on you,

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.870
then you must be whipped.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:23.710
Madam Cui,

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.270
are you ready?

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:27.750
Master,

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:29.320
are you prepared?

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.080
