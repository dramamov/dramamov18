00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.720
I don't think
there's anything to worry about.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.520
Liusu is smart.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.550
Maybe she'll be back any minute now.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.190
Su never turns off her phone.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.110
Her phone battery
never drops below fifty percent.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.080
Where could she have gone?

00:01:31.222 --> 00:01:33.555
Don't worry,
the police are already looking for her.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.310
No way, I'll go look for her too.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.310
Mo Li, where are you going?

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.288
I'm going to find her.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.550
You're awake.

00:02:33.577 --> 00:02:36.377
Do you have anything to do
with what happened to the Lu family?

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.670
Well, you know so much.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.270
What good does it do for you?

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.710
Are you out of your mind?

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:42.960
What you're doing is illegal!

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.390
You'll go to jail for this!

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.270
Stay still!

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.520
Help. Help!

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.760
Help! He...

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.590
Is anyone there?

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.480
I'll give you a surprise later.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.870
Guess who's coming to your rescue?

00:03:06.155 --> 00:03:07.760
Mo Li said he went to look for her.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.270
Where could that be?

00:03:09.577 --> 00:03:11.830
I met with those relocated residents
this afternoon.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.977
(Illegal Demolition, Give Back Homes)
Get out of the car! Get out!

00:03:13.977 --> 00:03:14.888
You, get out!

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.133
Actually, I think
Mr. Xingchen's plan is feasible.

00:03:19.111 --> 00:03:20.550
The company is without a leader.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.550
Mr. Xingchen, I need to leave now.

00:03:23.777 --> 00:03:25.640
I have to deal
with the company matters first.

00:03:27.244 --> 00:03:28.600
No... Something's off.

(Baozhu, wait for us at home.)

(Shi Yue, keep an eye on your phone.
Notify the police if there's any news.)

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.670
Starting today,
we're all in the same boat,

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.590
Mr. Mo.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.110
You idiot.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.870
I told you
to keep your hands off Gu Liusu!

00:04:00.244 --> 00:04:02.400
Where exactly
are Mr. Lin's wife and child?

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.040
You've pushed your luck!

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.320
Who do you think you are to question me?

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.760
Who do you think you are?

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.080
Stop it!

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.880
Please spare me!

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.790
Stop it!

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.000

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.440

Gu Liusu!

00:05:05.444 --> 00:05:07.022
Are you okay?

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.030
Mo Li.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.790
Call the police.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:15.390
Hurry.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.044
No, we should go to the hospital first.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.520

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.030

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.440
Do you still remember me?

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.520
You're my Gu Nian.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.080
How do you know I'm Gu Nian?

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.270

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.350
can save her.

Money?

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.150
Company shares?

00:06:35.244 --> 00:06:36.440
I'll give it all to you.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.150
Whatever you want, you can have it.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.680
Let Gu Liusu go first.

I want love!

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.470
I want a family.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.520
I want them to respect me.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.880
I want my mom's love.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.830

(Deal?)

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.830
I want your love too.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.350
Do you love me?

00:07:44.533 --> 00:07:45.866
Whatever you want, I'll give you.

00:07:45.977 --> 00:07:47.879
Just put the knife down, okay?

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.320
What gives?

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.960
Why do you always get everything
I ever wanted so easily?

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.030
Mo Li, calm down.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.320
Calm down? How can I calm down?

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.350
Why do you always have to show off?

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.230
Do you really love Gu Liusu?

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.230
You're just hurting her!

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.590

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:56.230

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.350
