00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.440
(CEO Jung Lucia)

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.880
(Episode 91)

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.380
What's wrong? What is it?

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.490
Lucia, it's me.
I need you to come and save me.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.190
These guys have been dragging me
all over the place.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.800
Now they're taking me to the Merry Motel
at the Mucheon intersection.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.770
I'm texting you while they're not looking.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.870
Please hurry and get me out of here.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.040
This...

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.510
Are you sure this is from
Chairman Min's number?

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.280
Yes.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.610
If he were kidnapped and held captive,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.380
they definitely would have taken
his phone.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.250
Which means the person who sent this...

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.490
must be the one who kidnapped
Chairman Min Doo Sik.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.560
And there must be a reason
they're using his number to do it.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.660
That's what I think too,
but what if it's real?

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.130
What if Chairman Min somehow got his phone
and managed to send this text for help?

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.900
We can't rule that out completely.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.840
Then there's only one thing to do.
We have to go see for ourselves.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.150
(Merry Motel)

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.720
This seems to be the address
from the text.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:56.860
(Merry Motel)

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.290
Should we go in?

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.390
Something doesn't feel right.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.190
Is it because of what happened
in the supply room?

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.100
- Still, we have to check.
- Just stay right beside me.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.440
If anything happens,
run while I buy you some time.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.710
And call the police.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.140
(Merry Motel)

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.250
I had a feeling he wouldn't be here.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.750
It didn't seem like
just a prank text, though.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.450
Let's just go.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.720
We need to get out of here now.
We can't stay here any longer.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.190
Why?

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.590
I just have a really bad feeling
about this.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:09.890
Let's go. Now.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.380
(Mingang Distribution)

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.910
This has to be a trap.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.010
If it's a trap, it's a strange one.
Nothing happened.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.750
That's what makes me so uneasy.
In any case, hold onto that text message.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.320
We'll have to find out
who sent it eventually.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.360
I shouldn't have suggested we go there.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.890
We didn't have any other choice.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.800
Trap or not, we had to see for ourselves.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.800
But why on earth would someone
send a text like that?

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.350
Why are you so startled?

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.480
It's nothing.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.730
The more I see her, the more she looks
like the woman on the flyer.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.260
I'm sure of it.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.100
What took you so long?

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.410
Come on.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.230
Did you find anything?
It is Baek Sul Hee, isn't it?

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.890
Lucia is an impostor, right?
She has to be.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.560
- No, you're wrong.
- What?

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.600
That's impossible.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.570
I'm positive the face on that flyer
is Madam Jung.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.000
I'm telling you,
I saw it with my own two eyes.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.810
That woman, Baek Sul Hee,

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.610
is already dead.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.940
What?

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.480
No way.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.050
Then...

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.450
are you saying
they're not the same person?

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.650
Lawyer Kim got this from her family.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.590
Just to be sure,
I contacted the issuing agency,

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.630
and they confirmed it's correct.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:21.930
That's strange.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.730
How can that be?

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.500
So you don't have to worry
about it anymore, Manager Gong.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.730
The woman is dead. What can we do?

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.600
(Merry Motel)

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.800
- So this is why they lured us there.
- This has to be Kim Sun Jae's doing.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.040
Well, what do we have here?
How scandalous.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.440
Going to a motel in broad daylight?

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.910
You two must be desperate for each other.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.540
What do you think you're doing?

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.210
I get that your old husband
can't satisfy you,

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.880
but for a married woman to be sneaking
into motels with her lover.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.320
Have you no shame?

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.820
Who do you think should be ashamed?

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.330
To do something so despicable
without even batting an eye.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.330
The chairman's kidnapping and confinement.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.030
Do you really think
you can get away with this?

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.770
Can you swear on your conscience
that you have nothing to do with this?

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.830
Then go ahead and report me to the police.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.600
Instead of just running your mouth,
find some evidence and file a lawsuit.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.070
That'll be your fastest route.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.240
Just because there's no proof
doesn't mean you're not guilty.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.310
If a lack of evidence
doesn't prove innocence,

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.310
what do we do with this undeniable proof?

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.310
Faced with such a blatant affair,

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.250
should I leak this to the news?

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.150
- Watch your mouth. An affair?
- What's this? What's going on?

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.630
You two, what is this?

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.000
Come with me.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.850
Go ahead.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:28.950
An explanation, an excuse, whatever.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.920
Actually, no.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.760
It's not like you can
explain away an affair.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.190
Stay out of this.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.900
It's nothing.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.000
The nerve.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.170
You're awfully bold for someone
caught red-handed.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.180
I get a text like this,
and I'm not supposed to go?

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.240
It was a text from the chairman's number.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.480
He was letting me know
he'd been kidnapped.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.650
He was desperately waiting to be rescued.
Was I supposed to just ignore that?

00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:59.920
You're saying...

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.450
the chairman sent this text?

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.520
If it wasn't the chairman,

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.390
then it must have been his kidnapper.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.500
I find that hard to believe.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.270
What kidnapper would be so audacious?
They'd be caught.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.470
It's entirely possible
if they had another motive.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.340
If the point was to set a trap...

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.370
and lure someone into it.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.010
So who are you suggesting
the kidnapper is?

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.280
I don't have to spell it out, do I?
For either of you.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.150
Don't be ridiculous.

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:34.550
Don't think I'm just going to
let this slide.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.620
This goes beyond the company's image.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.360
Seeing my father get deceived like this,

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:39.960
I simply cannot tolerate it
as his daughter.

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.990
After all Father has done for you,
how could you have an affair?

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:45.400
You should have some common decency.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.130
And with Father missing,

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.700
you saw this as your golden opportunity?

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.970
Do you really think I'll ever forgive you?

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:02.380
So this was Kim Sun Jae's plan all along.
He intended to frame us for an affair.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.150
I never thought he'd go this far.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:06.550
What do we do now?

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.420
No matter how much
we insist we're innocent,

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.950
it doesn't seem like they'll believe us.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.820
I know.
They're determined to push this narrative.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.030
I can't believe it. I showed her the text,
and she's still like this.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.300
Was this your doing?

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.030
Does that really matter?

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.300
What matters is that they're now cheaters
and everyone is pointing fingers.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.170
What about the text message on her phone?

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.310
You handled that perfectly well earlier.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.440
We just have to
keep pushing our narrative.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.080
The thing about an affair scandal is,

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.650
by the time they prove their innocence,
their reputations will be ruined.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:42.250
Until their innocence is proven,
the public condemnation and humiliation...

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.460
will drive them crazy.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:48.030
Shouldn't you have discussed this with me
before you went ahead with your plan?

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.590
Good thing I caught on quickly.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.130
There was no time.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.030
I couldn't risk losing the opportunity.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.500
For now, if we claim that
the two of them secretly conspired...

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.870
to kidnap and hold the chairman captive,
the story should seem plausible.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.570
That makes sense.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.880
And one more thing. You need to get
the directors on your side.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.610
Make sure to brand them as traitors,

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.950
but publicly, you must be magnanimous.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.390
Like it or not, you need their shares.

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.650
Every last bit of it.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.300
Hey, did you see this?

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.770
Don't you know these photos are
all over the lobby?

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.440
That's a motel.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.410
They went to a motel together?

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.680
They must have gone in and out many times
to get their picture taken.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.680
If you do something shady long enough,
you're bound to get caught.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.020
What a bombshell.
How could they do something like that?

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.790
But you're acting strange.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.020
You used to go to Kyung Chae first
when stuff like this happened.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.730
- So why come to me now?
- I don't know.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.730
Since Kyung Chae became acting chairman,
she's just hard to approach.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.730
It feels weird even trying to talk to her.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:03.730
When I see her sitting
in the chairman's office,

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.600
it feels weird asking her anything.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.170
Well, you could just ask
the person involved directly.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:11.180
(CEO Jung Lucia)

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.680
(Mingang Distribution)

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.550
What is this?

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:23.450
Did you skip kindergarten?

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.220
No matter how urgent it is,
you should knock first.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.660
Stop changing the subject
and answer me. What is this?

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.700
Are you and Director Moon really involved?

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.900
And if I said no, would you believe me?

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.970
No.
Not with proof right in front of my face.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.110
How could I?

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.040
Then why ask
if you've already made up your mind?

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.780
I'm not Dad's biggest fan,
but this is just wrong.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.320
After everything Dad has done for you?

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.320
No, it's not.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.560
Yes, it is.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.530
For goodness' sake.
If you have something to say, just say it.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.540
Director, I think the team has something
they want to say to you.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.040
Do you have something to say to me?

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.270
What is it? Go on, speak up.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.110
I give you the perfect opening,
and you clam up.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.650
After whispering and sneaking glances
all day.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.320
Am I that interesting to all of you?

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:32.960
Don't you realize you're the talk
of the company today?

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.490
I'm that "hot," am I?

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.500
I was really going to let this slide,

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.770
but I need a word with you.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.200
Follow me.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:52.880
Hey, you!

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.650
Do you think Father is a pushover?
An affair? Are you kidding me?

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.450
This has gone way too far.
You're an animal.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.190
Of all the women out there...

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.090
On paper, she's my stepmother.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.690
Listen here, Vice Director Min.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.460
You don't know the first thing about it,

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.360
so you'd better watch your mouth.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:12.930
What? The guilty one gets to be angry now?
Are you yelling at me?

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.900
Back in the day,
you'd be in jail for this.

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:18.600
My gosh, look who it is.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.710
If it isn't Mingang Distribution's
adulterer of the century.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:25.310
Darn it!

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.850
It's always the women who are the problem.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.350
They're just so easy, you know?

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:37.760
As a man, seeing it from your side,
I can totally understand.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.160
What man could resist when a woman
throws herself at him like that?

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.260
Hey, watch your mouth.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.430
She doesn't deserve to be talked about
like that by you.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.730
Listen to you, defending her honor.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.740
So devoted to our dear mother-in-law.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.310
You know what I consider the worst trash
in the world?

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.450
A man who discards the woman who loves him
like an old shoe just to get ahead.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:05.580
What do you think about that?

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.960
I'm talking about a certain man I know.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.730
He abandoned the woman who devoted
her entire life to supporting him,

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:18.260
and even denied his own child
in her womb before taking off.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.970
A man who can't love or be responsible
for his own woman to the very end.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.740
What would a man like that
know about anything?

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.170
When I first heard that story,

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.810
I felt so sorry for the woman, you know?

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:31.440
But on second thought,

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:33.240
I think she's better off.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.780
Because clearly, she was way too good
for a piece of trash like that.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.250
Should a piece of gold...

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:42.050
be sitting next to a pile of crap?

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:43.350
Right?

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:53.930
A pile of crap?

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:55.230
A pile of crap?

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.040
Why that jerk...

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.740
What? An affair scandal?

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.140
I told you to be careful.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:11.150
Min Kyung Chae needs a reason
to get the directors back on her side,

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.550
and this is just perfect for her,
isn't it?

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:16.120
I never thought she'd fake a scandal
to use against us.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.820
Now she'll use this incident
with you two...

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.090
to get the directors back under her thumb.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.830
Siding with a CEO
whose integrity is in question...

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.560
is something the directors can't justify.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.430
I suppose that's true.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:34.510
If the directors go back to Min Kyung Chae
and give her their stake,

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.240
we don't stand a chance,
no matter what we do.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.910
I know,

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.310
but right now, I'm more worried about her.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.450
With Chairman Min Doo Sik gone,
she has no one to protect her.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.820
I don't know how she'll survive
in that hellhole of a house.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.320
So, those two are...

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.620
Gosh, I can't even bring myself to say it.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.890
So they're having an affair, is that it?

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.100
They went to a motel in broad daylight.
It's obvious, isn't it?

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.870
Where does that leave your father?

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:04.700
Exactly!

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:09.170
I'm not Father's biggest fan,
but today, I felt so sorry I almost cried.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:13.410
He was happy to have a young wife so late.
What a shame.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:17.510
He had no idea what she was really like,
giving her shares and even the CEO spot.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.320
So that's why she didn't
share a room with your father.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:24.920
Since moving in, she's been making excuses
to sleep in a separate room.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:28.290
It all makes sense now.
Once you've had a taste of a younger man,

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.260
how could an old man like Father
ever satisfy her?

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.600
Anyway, where on earth is Father?

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.370
This whole house is falling apart.

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.270
I should tell Manager Gong.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.390
Manager Gong, have you heard the news
about our stepmother?

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:57.450
Oh, please.
Don't be so formal. "Stepmother?"

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.460
There's no need for that,
especially when it's just us.

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.230
I know, but you have to be careful.

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.200
The walls have ears.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.630
That's not the saying,
but I get your point.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.000
Then again,
that's not what's important right now.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.570
With the chairman gone,

00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:16.870
the real problem is that vixen
showing her true colors.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.910
- So you've heard?
- From Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:36.630
- Why do you have Stepmother's picture?
- Look closely.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.100
It's not just any picture.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.800
You see Director Moon Tae Kyung
from the Online Business Team, right?

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.970
It's them,
going into a motel and coming out.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.040
A motel?

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.810
So Stepmother and Director Moon are...

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.680
This is the true face of the woman
you trust and admire so much.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.680
Do you get it now?

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:59.350
She planned this from the very beginning,
worming her way into our family.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.750
Father was just a fool
who danced to her tune.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.720
Why would you take a picture like this?
It's from a hidden camera, isn't it?

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.920
Does that even matter?

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:08.960
Is it really a coincidence
Father is missing?

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.360
If it were a coincidence,

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:13.560
then why would she be running around
with another man right now?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Then...

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.530
are you saying Stepmother
did something to Dad?

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:23.140
Why are you calling?

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:24.580
I was worried about you.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.140
I'm sure everyone in that house
knows by now.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.650
Are you all right?

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:30.650
So far.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:34.080
This is nothing. Don't worry about me.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:35.550
Have you had dinner?

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.090
Not yet. I was just about to.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:39.590
What about you, Tae Kyung?

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.660
I ate a little while ago.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.530
That family may be completely fractured,

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.530
but they'll stick together like glue
when something like this happens.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.170
I'm ready for it.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.520
Manager Gong.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:20.560
So you're saying I'm not welcome
at this table?

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:24.670
Frankly, with all that's going on,
it's a bit much for us to eat together.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.540
Give me a break.
This isn't some trashy drama.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:32.540
I know this family is a total wreck,
but with Father-in-law gone,

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.440
eating with our mother-in-law,
who's seeing another man, is just...

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.380
I get that you were antsy,
but if you'd just waited...

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:40.880
for Father's return and the divorce,
then you could've gone to any motel.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:41.950
Who was going to stop you?

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:44.860
So, are you saying I did something wrong?

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:46.490
Whether you did or not,

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:50.560
- it's awkward between us now, isn't it?
- Us?

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:53.560
Since when was there an "us?"

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.470
You're only a family on paper.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.440
Weren't you all just
at each other's throats?

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.710
Hey, siblings fight.
That's just how it is.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:04.410
So, you'd rather we tear each other apart?

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:07.880
You clearly don't get that
blood is thicker than water.

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:11.820
So now this "blood is thicker than water"
family is going to gang up...

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.450
to attack me?

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.390
Well said. But no matter what, legally,

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.120
I am above every single one of you.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.220
What brats treat their own mother
this way?

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:24.930
You've got a lot of nerve, considering
you're the one having an affair.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:28.430
An affair?
Watch your mouth. Se Ri is right here.

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:46.850
Se Ri!

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.090
Please believe me. I've done nothing
for you to be ashamed of.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.560
Then why were you in a picture like that?

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.860
I was set up.
I don't know how to explain it, but...

00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:59.930
We don't even know where Dad is right now,

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.730
or if he's even dead or alive.

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:07.300
I don't get why you went
to a place like that with him.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.310
I'm sure I'd understand if you explained.
You must have had your reasons.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:15.650
But right now,
I don't want to understand you.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.220
Se Ri...

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.600
What are you doing here again?

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.670
Did you come to see if I was dead yet?

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.870
Of course. You have to stay alive.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.370
Spare me the empty words.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:45.110
Father-in-law.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.650
I need you to listen very carefully
to what I'm about to say.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:51.820
If you're still waiting for her, give up.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.690
She can't come here. Actually, she won't.

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.690
Her heart's elsewhere.
Why would she come back?

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:00.160
What are you talking about?

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.090
I don't know
if I should be showing you this.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.100
(Merry Motel)

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.670
Do you see now?

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.780
- Her true colors.
- Seriously, what is this?

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.880
Don't tell me those two...

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:23.450
You didn't know?

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:25.920
That those two have had
something special...

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.190
going on since the very beginning?

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:35.030
You expect me to believe this?
What trick are you pulling now?

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.290
You're willfully blind.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:39.130
You won't believe
the proof in front of you.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.230
I don't care what you say.
This garbage won't work on me.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.570
They're not like a scumbag like you.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.210
You pathetic old man.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.210
Fine.

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:53.310
Let's see what happens when the people
you trust most stab you in the back.

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:05.990
(Merry Motel)

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.360
(CEO Jung Lucia)

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.240
I don't get why you went
to a place like that with him.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.640
But right now,
I don't want to understand you.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:36.450
(Stepmother)

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.760
The person you are calling is unavailable.
Please leave a message after the tone.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:53.400
Come on,
are you really not going to tell me?

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.410
I have a right to know where you're going
and who you're meeting.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:59.940
I have something important to do.
Why are you acting so clingy?

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.180
Move!

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:04.850
You're not getting up to something,
are you?

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.920
If I find you fooling around
with some floozy,

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.750
I'm not going to
just sit back and take it.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.690
I may lose everything else,

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.260
but I'm the kind of woman
who protects her meal ticket and her man.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:18.160
For crying out loud.
You should join the army with that spirit.

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.560
This isn't for nothing.
I have a gut feeling!

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.670
A woman's intuition is a scary thing.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.130
It's even spookier than a ghost.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.370
And you, Oh Pan Sool.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.870
You know
you're being incredibly suspicious, right?

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.840
I only seem suspicious because you are.
Try being nice, and I'll seem nice.

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:34.510
I will be back!

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.520
I will be back?

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.350
You're going to spend a thousand dollars?

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:44.750
Oh Pan Sool!

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.570
This is your investment from back then.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:58.840
Wait, why are you giving it back?

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.810
And this is the profit
from that investment.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:15.190
What? This much, this quickly?

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:18.390
I, Stella, am a woman of her word.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.860
I was careful with your money, Pan Sool,
and it turned a profit in no time.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.600
But it's a shame.
If only we'd invested a bit more,

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.270
we could've seen much higher returns.

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:33.400
It's a bit of a letdown
that it was only this much.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.810
If I were to invest ten times this amount,

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.710
would the return also be ten times bigger?

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.980
Who invests just to get a tenfold return?

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.350
If you pick the right stock,

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:45.480
you could make a hundred times that.

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:53.520
Yes, of course. I'm all ears.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:54.960
I...

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:59.860
happen to know the bigwigs
at Gwangmyeong Securities.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.800
You know that investing is all about
inside information, right?

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.800
You have such a classy way with words.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.270
- "The bigwigs."
- Yes, the bigwigs.

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.610
Oh my, not that again.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.080
I'm going all in this time.

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:28.090
Excuse me, can we get two cappuccinos
over here?

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:31.090
And with an obnoxious amount of foam.

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:44.670
What's with the long faces?

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:46.880
Come on, look up.

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:52.220
Where's the bravado from when I was ousted
and put her in the CEO position?

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.520
(Merry Motel)

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:04.460
Failing to dismiss an immoral CEO
is a dereliction of duty.

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.760
Especially at a company like ours,
which is so wary of owner's family issues.

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:10.930
One should clean up one's own mess, right?

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:15.210
You directors need to clean up this mess.
I can't get my hands dirty, can I?

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:18.710
I'll be waiting.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.210
Because depending on how you handle this,
our relationship can be repaired.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.990
How convenient. You're both here.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:35.890
I won't beat around the bush.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.100
You need to step down from your position.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.400
And Director Moon Tae Kyung,
you're fired as well.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.870
What is the meaning of this?

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:51.140
Wait, regardless of the reason,
you can't just fire us like this.

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:54.310
After causing that affair scandal?
You have no shame.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.380
When you're told to get out,
you get out. Enough talking!

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:14.160
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.180
It'd be better if you had just resigned.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.680
Why make things so difficult for everyone?

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.720
Because I had no reason to.

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.590
Are you saying someone kidnapped
and locked him up?

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:39.190
The culprit is clearly the one who stands
to gain the most if Father disappears.

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.560
Go ahead, enjoy it while it lasts.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.630
The moment I'm approved as chairman,
you'll be the first one out.

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:47.200
So she's really taking advantage of Dad
being gone to make her move.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.200
I've found where Chairman Min is.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.600
