WEBVTT

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:03.840
A stepmother my own age.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.840
(Episode 87)

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.850
And a former subordinate, at that.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.610
Wasn't becoming
the lady of the house enough...

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.180
after seducing the old chairman?

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.390
Now you want us to treat you
as our mother?

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:15.920
You're far too greedy.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.310
I've put up with you until now
for Father's sake.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.550
But I don't have to do that anymore.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.350
Because, as of today, this is my seat,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.960
which means you're nothing now.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.130
That's enough. Please go upstairs.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.400
Mom, you should get inside, too.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.340
What in the world is going on?

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.910
I know our family tree is a mess,

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.810
but to do this at the dinner table...

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.150
Tell me about it.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.950
Kyung Chae and the stepmother
are really going at it.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.150
Did you see that just now,
when they threw that glass of water?

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.120
I thought stuff like that
only happened on TV.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.800
I think they're planning
to kick me out of the house.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.130
They've confined Chairman Min,
and now they're trying to get rid of me.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.140
We have to find Chairman Min
before it's too late.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.570
Actually, I just saw something strange.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.940
I saw Kim Sun Jae
secretly meeting with Driver Kim.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.810
So you're saying Driver Kim is involved
in Chairman Min's disappearance?

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.950
It's just a hunch,
but why else would they meet in secret?

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.120
What connection could those two
possibly have?

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.690
Then I guess we'll have to find out
for ourselves.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.900
Mr. Kim. Can I have a word with you?

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.500
I need you to check the dashcam
from the chairman's car.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.240
Why, all of a sudden?

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.050
You didn't already delete or dispose of
the footage from a few days ago, did you?

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.220
As far as I know, the policy is to keep it
for at least a week.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.320
That's true, but...

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.520
You didn't give the footage
to someone else, did you?

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.260
No, Madam. I mean, CEO Jung.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.960
Why would I ever do something like that?

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.700
Then there's no reason
you can't show us, is there?

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.530
I said, let's check it.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.170
It's just...

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.710
You'd better tell the truth.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.980
Or I'll have no choice but to report you.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.910
As a witness and an accomplice
to the chairman's disappearance.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.450
I was wrong.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.250
I didn't mean to,

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.890
but Lawyer Kim Sun Jae threatened me,
so I had no choice.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.940
CEO Min.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.480
We're in big trouble.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.110
Madam Jung has summoned Lawyer Kim.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.610
Why, all of a sudden?

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.050
She found out that I wasn't the one
who drove the chairman's car that day.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.990
And I think she's going
to grill the lawyer about it.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.790
I told CEO Jung everything.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.260
You told her that?

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.900
You should have denied it
until the very end!

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.800
I'm sorry!

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.900
She threatened to report me...

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.280
If you tell me where the chairman is now,
I can be lenient.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.350
But if you keep resisting,
my hands are tied.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.520
I'll have to punish you
according to the law.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.820
Did you say "the law?"

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.690
You dare lecture me about the law?

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.460
Do you think you know the law
better than I do?

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.990
If you want to pursue legal action,
you need to bring me proof to back it up.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.260
- You can't just accuse me without proof.
- The proof...

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.670
is the fact that the chairman vanished
without a trace.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.240
- That's the proof.
- Are you kidding me?

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.240
You just dragged me in here...

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.770
and are now accusing me
of kidnapping the chairman.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.240
Haven't you heard of
"innocent until proven guilty?"

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.010
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.850
There are criminals who leave no evidence.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.220
Then what's a conscience for?

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.750
Conscience, you say.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.590
It's completely useless in a courtroom.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.530
Don't you know
it's not even worth a penny?

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.160
Your conscience might not
be worth a penny,

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.630
but some people would die to keep theirs.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.330
If you continue to illegally hold
the chairman captive...

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.000
Watch your mouth!
Who's illegally confining anyone?

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.410
The two of you really have a knack
for cornering someone.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.240
If you accuse me one more time
without any proof, I won't let it slide.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.750
I'll have you both thrown
in jail for defamation.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.210
You!

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.790
As of today, you're fired.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:50.990
What?

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.220
Did you not hear me?

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.860
I said you're fired, effective today.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.130
As CEO of Mingang Distribution,

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.930
I'm relieving Kim Sun Jae,
head of the Legal Team,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.400
of his duties as of today.
Is that clear enough for you?

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.270
Can you really do this
just because you're the CEO?

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.870
You kidnapped and imprisoned someone,
but you don't want to get fired for it?

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.810
I can't have someone like you here.
Who knows what else you might do?

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.280
Get out now!

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.920
I'm afraid
I can't approve that termination.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.090
Regarding the termination of Kim Sun Jae,
head of the Legal Team,

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.030
I'm exercising my right to veto.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.830
Veto?

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.630
What gives you the right?

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.270
I believe this gives me
all the right I need.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.830
Check the chairman's will.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.310
See who he designated as Acting Chairman
in his absence.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.840
How did you know this was going to happen?

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.040
Driver Kim gave me a call.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:16.910
You saw that, didn't you?

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.910
Lucia is putting on a real show
as CEO of Mingang Distribution.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.280
She can try, but that won't work on me.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.050
As I understand it, I don't need approval
from the board of directors,

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.320
so I can assume my duties immediately
after the will is read, correct?

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.790
Of course.
Legally, you are now the acting chairman.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.360
Finally, it feels like
Mingang is getting back on track.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.990
We have a lot of work ahead of us.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.630
We have to properly deal with
the board members who betrayed you.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.170
And we need to oust Lucia
from the CEO position,

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.470
and get rid of Moon Tae Kyung
while we're at it.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.510
That's right.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.010
There's more to do than I thought.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.080
What are you doing here?

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:00.850
Weren't you fired?

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.620
What are you doing
in the chairman's office?

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.060
What's all this about?

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.730
I've called you both here...

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.270
to reveal a part of the chairman's will.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.270
Dad's will?

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.440
Is that legally possible
without him present?

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.740
Under normal circumstances, no.
But this is an emergency.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:26.710
That's why we are only revealing a portion
of the will, not the entire document.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.510
I'm doing this as the lawyer
who notarized the will.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.820
Why the big rush?

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.890
Revealing the will isn't the priority
right now, is it?

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.190
Finding Dad should come first.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:38.960
It's been more than a day or two,

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.130
don't you think this is
a pretty serious situation?

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.930
So, you're saying we should just leave
the chairmanship vacant?

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.500
Who would that benefit?

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.530
As if being CEO wasn't enough for Lucia,

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.700
do you really want to see her become
Acting Chairman too?

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:53.000
Absolutely not.
She never should have been CEO.

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.340
Exactly. That's why we need to
make the will public to see...

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.780
who Father designated as Acting Chairman
if his position becomes vacant.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:01.410
Aren't you curious?

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.980
Fine. Let's just open
that darn will already.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.920
Just hurry up and do it. Come on, open it.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.190
Very well. I will now disclose
the chairman's will.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.460
"I, Min Doo Sik,"

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.900
"in the event of a prolonged absence
due to personal matters or illness,"

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.330
"or any other unavoidable reason..."

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.500
"that prevents me
from performing my duties,"

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.440
"I hereby appoint
as my Acting Chairman..."

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.770
"Min Kyung Chae."

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:45.590
Then we're completely stuck.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.030
Min Kyung Chae is running things
as Chairman.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.060
It takes effect immediately
upon revealing the will,

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.700
with no need for the board's approval.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.630
Min Doo Sik, where on earth could he be?

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.040
If those two just play dumb
and stay quiet,

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.400
there's no way for us to find out.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:02.470
If this continues to drag on,

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:03.540
in the worst case,

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.410
we can't guarantee
Chairman Min Doo Sik will survive.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.750
She wouldn't go as far as
killing her own father, would she?

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.580
They're the kind of people
who'd do anything to cover their tracks.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.190
I can't believe this is happening.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.590
A part of me wishes he was locked
in a secret room...

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.730
and would just die a miserable death.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:26.560
Now we have to find and save that bastard
with our own hands.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.870
How ironic.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.140
First, let's try to figure out
where they might have hidden him.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.710
If Kim Sun Jae
orchestrated the kidnapping,

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:37.140
it's highly likely
he mobilized the people...

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:39.480
he normally uses as informants.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.710
We might not be completely in the dark.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.950
Really? How so?

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:47.790
In the vase in the chairman's office,

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.590
I planted a small bug.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.790
So that's why you were always
in his office arranging flowers.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.700
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.940
What an eyesore.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.380
Secretary Kim, get this vase
out of the chairman's office...

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.920
Let's go. I made dinner reservations.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.460
Cancel them. I'm not in the mood.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.530
Dinner was just an excuse.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.430
There's something I really need
to discuss with you.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.500
About our marriage.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.900
- Do we have to talk about it now?
- Yes, I think we really do.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.540
You know our marriage was the condition...

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:42.940
to stop the chairman
from changing the will.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.140
Backing out now goes against our deal.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:47.040
Our "deal?"

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:51.550
- It's strange to call marriage a "deal."
- And why is that?

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.890
Are you still hung up on the man
who painted your portrait?

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:56.720
I told you not to bring that up.

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:58.590
Do you still have feelings for him?

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.030
I don't care.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.400
You can spend your entire life
thinking about and missing him.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.800
I'm big enough to handle that.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.270
But you should really think about this.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.970
Think about the value of me, Kim Sun Jae,

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:16.740
and not about some childish crush.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.640
I was planning to propose
at a nice restaurant,

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.680
but doing it here in the chairman's office
seems more fitting.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:25.580
After all, the ultimate goal
for both of us...

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.950
is this very seat, isn't it?

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.330
What? Should I get down
on one knee or something?

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.260
What's this?

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.390
Did you get proposed to?

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:09.230
Who was it?

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.060
Lawyer Kim Sun Jae.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.400
Are you really going to marry him?

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.570
Does the chairman's absence have anything
to do with this marriage?

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.850
My hunch is right, isn't it?

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.510
Lawyer Kim has the chairman
locked up somewhere, doesn't he?

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:32.080
I told him to do it.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.220
What on earth are you thinking?

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.620
It's my only way to get the chairmanship
and protect our company.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.330
What if getting
too involved with Lawyer Kim...

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.190
lands you in deeper trouble later?

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.330
Manager Gong,

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.330
you're the only one who knows
Se Ri is my daughter.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.970
At this point, you knowing one more secret
won't change a thing.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:55.870
Taking over Mingang is impossible
without Lawyer Kim's help.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.540
Ms. Kyung Chae...

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.540
I know exactly what kind of man he is.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.980
Spending the rest of my life
married to him...

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.620
will probably be more horrifying
than I can imagine.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.350
It could end up being
a total disaster for both of us.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.520
Then why are you doing this?

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.190
I told you why.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.190
I need him to get my hands on Mingang.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:17.490
I'll handle this, so don't you worry.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.030
Just go and prepare a meal for our guest.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.830
Lawyer Kim will be coming over
to be formally introduced.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.640
Wait, so Kyung Chae is taking over
the chairmanship instead of your father?

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.570
That's what the will says. What can we do?

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:35.210
What? So your stepmom is the CEO,
and your sister becomes the chairman,

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:37.580
and you're the only one left with nothing!

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.690
Father is unbelievable!
Seriously, what the heck is he up to?

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:43.550
How could he write a will like that
and just disappear?

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.190
Seriously, where is he?

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:50.160
He's probably hiding to test all of you,
just like he did with that dementia scare.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.360
What's left for him to test?

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.700
These endless tests are ridiculous!

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.130
How should I know?

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:02.170
Anyway, your father's disrespect
for you makes me sick.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:04.380
What's the point
of having all that money...

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:07.810
- if he treats his only son like this?
- Exactly.

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:12.050
When you add up all Father's assets,
how much is it all worth?

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.220
What is he planning to do
with all of it? Seriously!

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:29.930
Open the door, you bastards!

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.100
Do you have any idea how much I'm worth?

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.540
The day I get out of here,
you're all dead men.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.180
I'll use my money to wipe you off
the face of the earth.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.980
Open this door
while I'm still asking nicely!

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.380
Open the door, you bastards!

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.890
Are you seriously going
to serve as the acting chairman?

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.430
I thought that was already settled
at the company.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.860
If the chairman returns tomorrow...

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.000
and learns you opened the will
without consent...

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:06.170
and took his seat, he won't let it slide.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:07.540
Don't you know how he is?

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.240
That's something I'll deal with
if Father returns.

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:13.040
You make it sound like
you don't expect him to come back.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.310
Is that how it sounded to you?

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:16.810
I can't help what you hear.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.800
It's nice having just the Min family here
for a change.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.200
What's so nice about it? Dad's missing.

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:40.300
- Is anyone even worried?
- He'll probably be back soon.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.610
And what if he doesn't?

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:43.070
Then there's nothing we can do.

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:44.910
Kyung Chae!

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.310
Sit down.
Making a scene won't change anything.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.450
Does anyone else think this family
is seriously messed up?

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.720
How come no one is worried
even though Dad is missing?

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.890
Your father does have a history
of pulling stunts like this.

00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:00.260
This isn't the first or second time
he's deliberately tricked us.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.860
Even so, he's still missing.
Shouldn't we be looking for him?

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:07.430
- Don't worry. We are looking for him.
- Did you file a missing person report?

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:09.000
What about Mingang's stock price?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.770
Are you suggesting
we announce his absence?

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.940
I've hired private investigators
to find him.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.410
Even now, you're worrying
about the company’s stock price, right?

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:17.610
This is infuriating.

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:28.090
(Mingang Distribution)

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.120
There's nothing of interest.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.720
Absolutely nothing that could be a clue
to Chairman Min's whereabouts.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.130
Then what should we do?
I was counting on this.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:10.560
There's nothing we can do.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.260
We'll put this back,

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.600
and wait until those two
let something slip...

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:17.840
on Chairman Min Doo Sik.

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:43.690
What are you doing in here?

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.360
What does it look like?

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:49.600
Since the chairman isn't here,
let's get rid of that.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:52.370
He'll be back soon.
Don't you dare touch it.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.840
Leave it.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.240
He was fond of it.

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:03.410
You're his daughter.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.420
Now that your father's gone,

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.120
shouldn't you cherish his things
so much...

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.890
that you can't bear to touch them?

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:11.160
So why are you in such a rush
to throw it out?

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:14.560
Is it not just the chairman you find
to be an eyesore, but his things as well?

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.030
Watch your mouth.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.400
Why would I consider the chairman
an eyesore?

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.060
Then don’t you dare lay a finger
on any of this.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.800
If you get rid of it on your own whim,

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.670
I'll take it
you're not hoping he'll return.

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.170
And that you're treating him
like he's gone for good.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.770
Who do you think you are to say that?

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.580
Just put up with me for one month.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.480
One month.

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:38.950
If the chairman isn't back within a month,
I'll leave on my own.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.420
From both the house and the company.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:45.620
You can take his seat at the table,
take over his office, and live your life.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.830
Then we won't have to throw water
on each other again.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:51.830
As you said before,
with the chairman gone,

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.760
I'm nothing anyway.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.430
One month, you say?

00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:59.270
Don't you dare go back on your word.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.510
I won't.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.950
- What can I get for you?
- I'll have the goat soup, please.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.090
- One goat soup!
- Yes, please.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.090
Come on, gather around, everyone.
Before the real cold weather sets in,

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.560
you should have some black goat extract
to stay healthy.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.430
This is the real deal, an extract we brew
right here in our store.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.840
A health tonic like this
would make a perfect gift.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.470
- Right? Should I get you one?
- Yes, please.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:36.970
Nice choice.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.140
- I'd like to pay for this.
- Thank you.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:47.320
Here you go. I hope this brings you
a long and healthy life.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.920
- Thank you.
- Look at you, you're on a roll.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.760
I'm so sorry. I feel bad
making you work on your day off.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.200
Not at all. I'm excited
to see all these customers too!

00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.700
Yes, thank you.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.700
- Enjoy it in good health!
- Thank you so much.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.670
- Great.
- Ta-da!

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.900
We're here, Father, Mother.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:10.740
Welcome, come on in! Now you're here,
you have to drink this down.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:12.880
It's a fresh batch. It'll taste good.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:17.180
Don't leave a single drop. Bottoms up!

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:18.950
This is potent.

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.950
I can feel myself
getting stronger already.

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.720
So that's what you use to make it.

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:27.790
That's right.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.030
You see those jars of medicinal herbs?

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:34.230
Honey, should we buy one of these
for your father?

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.530
What's the point?
Dad's not even home to receive a gift.

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:41.570
What in the world are you talking about?
Why wouldn't he be at home?

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:43.970
He's gone missing.

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.480
"Missing" is a bit of a strong word.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.210
I think he's just taking
a break somewhere.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.480
He'll be back soon.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:51.680
Why would he go somewhere else to rest
when he has a huge house?

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.350
The older you get,
the more you should be with family.

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.370
(Mingang Distribution)

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.040
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.510
If the chairman isn't back within a month,
I'll leave on my own.

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:26.810
From both the house and the company.

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:31.150
Go ahead, try and find him
if you're so clever.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.720
You won't find him in a month,
or even a lifetime.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:45.700
You wanted to see me?

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:49.970
Are you happy now?

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.710
Come to my house tonight.

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:57.510
It's time you met my family.

00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.010
I guess we should book
a wedding venue, then.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.410
If we're doing this,
we may as well get it over with...

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:02.510
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:04.750
Let's just have an engagement party.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.080
An engagement party?

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:08.450
But if we're going to do it,
why not just get married?

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.750
The timing is bad.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:12.320
To the public, Father is missing.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.360
Should I be holding a wedding right now?

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:16.360
What would people think?

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:17.990
But an engagement party is just...

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:19.700
We might as well get married
while we're at it.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.870
Don't argue with me. Just do as I say.

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:25.670
We'll get married once I can drop
the "Acting" from my title...

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.510
and I'm officially the chairman.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.010
And for that to happen,

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.710
you'll have to sign over...

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.580
your Mingang Distribution shares
to me, won't you?

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:36.450
That's not a problem.

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:38.820
As long as I have your word
that we'll get married.

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.020
What did you want to see me about?

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:43.320
Don't you think it's weird?

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.060
Kyung Chae read the will
right after Dad vanished,

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.220
as if she was just waiting for it.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.230
Come on. She said it's because
the chairmanship can't be left vacant.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.430
You really don't think Dad's disappearance
and her revealing the will are connected?

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.330
If Dad were still here,
she never would've become Acting Chairman.

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:00.640
Are you saying Kyung Chae
did something to Father?

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:03.570
She would know best, wouldn't she?

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:05.640
Now that you mention it, it is suspicious.

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.050
But we don't have any proof.
You can't just make accusations like that.

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:11.980
It always comes down to proof, doesn't it?

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:22.730
What are you thinking about?

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:24.560
About Dad.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.460
I told you, he's fine. Don't worry.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.700
Do you know where he is?

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:32.100
How would I know?

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.140
I just have a feeling he's okay.

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:38.140
Worrying about him won't change anything,
so just try to relax.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.280
And come downstairs in a bit.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:41.610
We're having a guest.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:43.710
A guest? Who?

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:45.120
Listen...

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:47.880
How would you feel if I got married?

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:50.620
Where is this suddenly coming from?

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:55.630
I'm just wondering how you'd feel
if I told you I was getting married.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:00.130
Because he would become your new dad.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.130
What's gotten into you?

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:04.130
And what's all this about a guest?

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:08.170
Don't tell me...

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:09.440
Are you getting married?

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.740
Manager Gong, when is dinner tonight?

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:19.120
She's been preparing for a guest all day,
is it still not ready?

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.550
A guest?

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:22.520
The guest will be here any minute.

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:24.550
Who's this guest?

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.520
The man I'm going to marry.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.860
Wait, you're doing what?

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.100
She said she's getting married!

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.630
Oh my! Are you getting married?

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:36.730
- With whom?
- He's on his way.

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.540
So you're just going
to introduce your fiancé to us?

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.810
But what kind of lunatic would actually
want to marry an ice queen like you?

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.910
Is that guy out of his mind?

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:51.450
Come on. But who is it?

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:52.980
What does he do?

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.190
How old is he? Is he handsome?

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.410
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.840
My name is Kim Sun Jae,
and I'm going to marry Min Kyung Chae.

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:26.050
I'm sure I need no further introduction.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.250
I look forward to getting
to know you, brother-in-law.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:34.360
And to my new sisters-in-law,
I hope we get along.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:40.700
And...

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.430
you as well, Mother.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.100
I've always heard that a good son-in-law
is a treasure to his mother-in-law.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.470
I hope you'll grow very fond of me.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:51.440
Mother.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.930
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.980
Min Se Ri
is Min Kyung Chae's real daughter.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.550
She had her in secret 20 years ago...

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:32.150
and passed her off
as Chairman Min Doo Sik's own child!

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.920
Then what would you do
if something were to happen to Se Ri?

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.650
I couldn't live
if anything happened to her.

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:38.860
And I'd never forgive the one responsible.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.160
You were always so perfect
and untouchable.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.230
But now I've finally found your weakness.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:45.860
I would give whoever gets me
out of here...

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:48.570
all of Mingang Distribution
without a second thought.

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:50.130
I don't care who it is.

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.900
