WEBVTT

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.710
She's right.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.910
Father amended his will a few days ago.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.810
As for the acting chairman,

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.980
he didn't choose me.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.880
He chose Jung Lucia.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.160
What? What did you say?
No, am I hearing this right?

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.920
This is completely ridiculous...

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.830
I won't believe it
until I see the will for myself.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.760
No, I refuse to believe it.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.230
There's no way Dad would just hand
his position over to you.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.500
This will all be settled
once we see the will.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.470
Go on. Show us the will.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.570
Since Father is in this state...
even if you can't show us the whole thing,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.280
with the notarizing lawyer present,
show us the part on the acting chairman.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.580
There's no need to confirm it.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.010
It's the truth.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.850
I heard it from
the notarizing lawyer myself.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.590
Now that you know,
could you all please leave?

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.230
I have much to learn for the chairmanship,
and I'm already swamped.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.800
(Episode 96)

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.370
How could this have happened?

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.440
Hey, how long have you known about this?

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.280
- Just recently.
- It's really written in Dad's will?

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.980
That he named her, not you,
and even had it notarized?

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.650
This is why you shouldn't have pulled
that stunt on Father.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.490
How could you expect the old geezer to be
in his right mind after what you did?

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.130
- You're always so extreme.
- It was Lawyer Kim's plan.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.400
I know that jerk is reckless,
but you should have stopped him!

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.260
That's not what's important right now.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.040
What's done is done.
Right now, our priority is stopping her.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.340
Gosh, I know that!
It's just so frustrating.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.910
The family knows everything now?

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.910
They can't do anything for now
because of the notarized will,

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.050
but they'll stop at nothing
to take this position from me.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.220
That makes sense.
It's very different from the CEO position.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.990
The chairmanship of Mingang Distribution.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.560
It symbolizes absolute power as the head
of the entire organization.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.030
It's a relief that Min Kyung Chae doesn't
currently hold a position at the company.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.130
The other two won't be able
to do much on their own.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.700
That's true,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.210
but what worries me is
their shareholdings.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.680
You mean Min Kyung Chae's
15 percent stake in Mingang?

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.650
Plus Director Min and the Vice Director,
who each hold seven percent.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.420
If those two side with Min Kyung Chae,
she'll become the majority shareholder.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.790
And if that happens, she can call
a shareholders' meeting anytime she wants.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.090
She could use a shareholders' meeting
to interfere with company affairs.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.530
They'll move to suspend your acting role.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.770
That's the only way
they can tie your hands.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.400
What if... what if Dad never wakes up?
Then Lucia will inherit the chairmanship.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.010
Hey! Don't say such terrible things!

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.740
Just hearing you say that is infuriating.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.840
That's exactly why we need
to stop her first.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.380
Should we call a board of directors
meeting right away?

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.950
Given what's at stake,
let's go right to a shareholders' meeting.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.520
I'll move for a suspension
of acting duties there.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.820
You'll use the owner family's shares
to oust her?

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.460
A suspension of acting duties?
That's a great idea.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.760
I'm a hundred percent on board.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.460
If you're on board,

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.400
then pool your shares with mine.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.200
My 15 percent plus
your seven percent each is 29 percent.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.170
That's more than Father's 28 percent.
We can win.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.380
You said the shares you received...

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.580
from Chairman Min were
seven percent, right?

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.050
Yes.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.120
Then what about the stock options
I received when I joined Mingang?

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.590
And how many shares does Madam Jang have?

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.320
Your shares and Madam Jang's
won't be of much help right now.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.390
In the end, it'll all be decided
by the owner family's shareholdings.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.060
Right. What happened to the
youngest daughter's shares?

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.600
Madam Jang has them.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.340
Even with Se Ri's 3 percent,
I'm only at 10 percent.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.440
Then there's no way we can compete
with their numbers.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.180
Chairman Min's shares are the key,
but in his current state,

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.350
his 28 percent is effectively useless.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.450
This is a huge problem.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.420
On top of Min Kyung Chae's shares,

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.480
if she gets Director Min
and Vice Director...

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.420
Oh man, she'll be completely unstoppable.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.130
That all sounds great,

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.030
but if we give you our stakes,
you'll be number one at Mingang.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.460
What about us? We'll be left with nothing.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.170
Now that you mention it, you're right.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.800
Look, stopping Lucia is important,
but we need to land on our feet, too.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.470
Don't worry.
I'll make sure you two are taken care of.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.010
What, you want it in writing?

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.310
I can call Lawyer Kim
and get it notarized.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.350
Think about it carefully.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.420
Actually, there's nothing to think about.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.360
Our family business is being taken over
by a woman who came out of nowhere.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.920
If you're having second thoughts now,
you're not a real Min.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.590
The chairman isn't just any old position.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.730
It's the identity and symbol of Mingang.
Why do you think we don't hire outsiders?

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.700
It's to ensure we keep control
within the family, no matter what.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.470
Lucia is Father's woman, not family.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.350
A "father's woman" only matters
while Father is healthy and in charge.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.450
Right?

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.390
So, how did it go?

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.190
If they know what's good for them,
they'll side with me.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.860
Ji Seop is a pushover,
so he should be easy to handle,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.400
but Director Min is the problem.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.730
Tell me about it.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.200
Ji Seop does whatever he's told,
so I'm not worried about him.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.040
But Soo Jung is always calculating.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.910
For now, let's just assume
we've secured their stakes.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.080
Let's go ahead and set a date
for the shareholders' meeting.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.110
- Where to now?
- Home.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.510
I'm exhausted from being
in the hospital for days.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.590
So, what do you think?
About what she said.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.190
She's got a point.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.090
It would be a disaster to hear people
call Lucia "Chairman."

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.930
That may be,
but to give her our entire stake...

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.630
She said she'd put it in writing.
You really think she'd break her word?

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.570
After everything she's put you through,
you still trust her?

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.400
It's not about wanting to trust her.
It's that I have to.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.340
Gosh, you just don't get it.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.550
Father is in a coma,
and Kyung Chae has amnesia.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.620
What in the world is going on?

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.180
Is our family cursed or something?

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.220
Manager Gong, we can't just stand here.
Maybe we should call in a powerful shaman.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.730
- And hold an exorcism?
- Are you seriously suggesting that now?

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.230
Oh my gosh! Hey, I'm being serious here.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.500
Why not?
Because bad things keep happening to us.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.240
I think I know why all these bad things
keep happening to our family.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.070
And why is that?

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.610
Because there's no real love
in our family.

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.780
Everyone's just fighting to get ahead,
and worrying about who gets the company.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.980
Why would you say such a thing?

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.480
It's true, though.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.090
We're a family in name only.
Let's be honest, are we really a family?

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.060
Oh my! Kyung Chae?

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.560
Wait, shouldn't you be in the hospital?
What are you doing here?

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.330
Then again, with your amnesia,
you probably don't even know who I am.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.470
Me?

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:13.970
I'm your sister-in-law.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.240
A sister-in-law...
That means your brother is my husband.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.480
I guess she doesn't get it.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.080
But why did she leave the hospital?

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.290
Oh, right! Your father collapsed
and is unconscious.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.820
You don't know about that, do you?

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.760
How would she know? She has amnesia.
It's a miracle she found her way home.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.970
So, why are you here?

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.400
Se Ri, aren't you even going
to greet your sister?

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.310
- Do you recognize me?
- Of course I do.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.340
I don't have amnesia. Don't worry.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.620
To be honest, it's been hard
for me to face you.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.890
I was scared after finding out
what you did to Dad.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.260
But...

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.460
when I heard you had amnesia,
I was worried about you.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.300
So are you saying you're
disappointed that I don't?

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.330
Why would I be disappointed?
I'm relieved and grateful.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.940
Then what's with the attitude?
Everything's fine now, isn't it?

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.340
Why did you lie about having amnesia
when you're perfectly fine?

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.940
If you hadn't done that to Dad,
none of this would be happening.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.210
What do you know about it?

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.780
What do you know about grown-up problems?

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.580
I did it because I had to.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.720
Lately, I've been thinking
it's all my fault.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:38.260
If I hadn't hit her and framed her,
she wouldn't have had to die like that.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:43.590
I caused an innocent person to die.
How can I ever be happy?

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:46.630
How can our family ever be happy?

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.070
Don't tell me you're talking about
what happened four years ago.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.100
I can't stop thinking about her.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.510
- I want to visit her at the columbarium.
- Nonsense!

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.080
People with no power and no money
get treated like that. That's how it is.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.810
You don't get how the world works, do you?
It's survival of the fittest.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.880
The weak get devoured by the strong.
That's the natural order of things.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.390
Don't say that!

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:12.360
I'm fighting for my life at the company,
while you're here just wallowing in guilt.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.230
Snap out of it.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.630
You should at least put in
half the effort that I do.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.260
How else am I supposed to pass
the chairman's seat on to you someday?

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.600
Why would I take your place?

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.040
I'm not interested in the company.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.110
If you want to pass it on,
give it to your own daughter someday.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.110
If Min Kyung Chae joins with
Min Soo Jung or Min Ji Seop,

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.750
then it's game over for us
before we even start fighting?

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:41.450
If the three of them combine their stakes,
that's exactly what will happen.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.420
If the motion to suspend
the duties of acting chairman is passed...

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.860
at the shareholders' meeting,
it'll really be the end for us.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.130
They're calling a shareholders' meeting
soon. What do we do?

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:53.600
Then before that happens, our only option
is to increase our stake in the company.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.300
That's too big of an undertaking,
and we don't have time. It's impossible.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.510
It'd be faster to sweet-talk Min Soo Jung
or Min Ji Seop.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.080
Getting them to turn their backs
on Min Kyung Chae would be faster.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.110
You're saying we should stop them
from giving her their stake?

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.820
Exactly.
First, we must drive a wedge between them.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.380
We absolutely cannot let them team up.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.590
Gosh, that Min Doo Sik.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.890
He's a pain to the very end.
Of all the times to be laid up in bed.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:43.110
The chairman must have told you
to get out of this house.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.020
Are you defying the chairman's orders?

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.220
Go ahead. Try and drag me out.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.790
Do you really want to be this pathetic,
putting on this whole amnesia show?

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.230
I'm not the pathetic one. You are.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.900
You used my father's backing
to snatch the acting chairman position.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:08.240
That was the chairman's decision.
I had nothing to do with it.

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:12.480
You may not have done it directly,
but you pulled strings to make it happen.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.880
Now you're just insulting the chairman.
He's not the type to be manipulated.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.150
He's a man who knows his own mind.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.750
It must've been fun, having a man like him
wrapped around your little finger.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.320
What did you say?

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.790
Getting married,

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.860
becoming CEO, and now acting chairman.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.060
You can't deny you've been manipulating
the chairman all along.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.370
You have some nerve to talk so big.
Who's to blame for his condition?

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:50.480
Those two are really two of a kind.
How can they be so alike?

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:55.190
To be blunt, it's Kyung Chae's fault
that Dad is unconscious.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.690
But it's true Lucia joined our family
and had Dad wrapped around her finger.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.560
So, whose side are you on?

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:05.900
They both have a point,
but right now, I'm siding with Kyung Chae.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.070
Kyung Chae is calling a special
shareholders' meeting soon.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.770
Looks like she plans to suspend Lucia's
duties as acting chairman.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.110
So our stepmother is screwed, then?
With Father unconscious,

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:17.810
there's no one left to take her side.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.110
She got too big for her britches,
relying on Dad's support.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.310
From now on, Kyung Chae's going
to lay down the law.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.550
Once she gets management control back,
she promised me a position.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:30.020
Really?
Kyung Chae really said she'd help you?

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.720
I'm telling you, she did.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:35.030
That's why I decided to back Kyung Chae
all the way this time.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.930
I'm going to give her my entire stake
so we can finally be a real team.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:44.340
So you're planning to oust her
while the chairman is unconscious?

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.640
I have to.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:49.810
Otherwise, I'll be kicked out of
the company not to mention the house.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.740
In a way, the chairman's condition
is an opportunity for you.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.280
I'll take care of everything.

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:57.550
Manager Gong,
you just keep an eye on Se Ri.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.620
She's saying strange things,
and it's worrying me.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.790
What did Se Ri say?

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.390
She brought up
that four-year-old accident.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.990
Like she feels sorry for the kid who died.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.460
See? I told you.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.590
I'm telling you, she did the same to me.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.730
I have no idea
why she keeps dwelling on it.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.830
You're sure nothing happened
while I was gone?

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:17.540
No.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.910
Actually, she has been acting
a bit strange lately.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.640
Just today, she was blaming her family,

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.680
and she was all over the place.

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:28.010
Really?

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.380
Times like this make me wonder
who Se Ri takes after.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:34.920
It's definitely not you, Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.520
Her biological father's side, maybe?

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:41.030
He was a good person.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.460
A struggling artist,

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.960
who never had a chance
to live out his dream.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.930
I miss him so much that...

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.500
I've even wished he had parents
or siblings who resembled him.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.540
He had no blood relatives at all?

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:58.810
Not a single one.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.910
It's too bad he didn't
at least have a mother.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:07.350
Then Se Ri would have had
a paternal grandmother.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.790
Imagine how much she would've doted
on her granddaughter.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.620
I know.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.840
What are you two doing here?

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:28.570
Nothing.

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:45.960
Is there any coffee left?

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.930
Here, have this.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.600
What's this? Why the sudden kindness?

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.130
Are you playing the part
of the doting mother now?

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:57.470
But I am your mother.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.840
I may not be your birth mother,
but by law, we're mother and daughter.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.440
So what? Am I supposed to be touched?

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.240
I'm not asking you to be touched.

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:09.810
But you're Min Soo Jung.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.880
I trust you'll be able to see
the situation for what it is.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.890
What's that supposed to mean?

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.960
Is this you telling me
not to side with Kyung Chae?

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:22.660
You're not wrong.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.160
At least you're honest.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.660
You have no reason to side
with her, do you?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.970
Everyone knows you two don't get along.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.740
Just because she and I don't get along,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.470
doesn't mean I have any reason
to side with you either.

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:36.810
Thanks for the coffee.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:00.130
- Yes? What's up?
- If you're at work, go somewhere quiet.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.210
What's going on?

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.980
Just in case.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.280
You need to keep working on Soo Jung.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.120
There's going to be
an emergency shareholders' meeting soon.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.290
You need to handle her
so there are no unfortunate surprises.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.560
Why?
Are you worried she'll side with them?

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:29.190
You know how she and I are.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.930
Even if you two are like cats and dogs,
this is no time to be divided.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.230
Don't worry. Your big brother
will take care of it.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.700
Okay, I'm hanging up.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:39.770
Hey! You!

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.240
Do you really think you can mess
with my family like this?

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.080
What is this all of a sudden?

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.810
I was so out of it I let it slide,

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.320
but you have no right
to do this to my father.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.650
After everything he's done for you?

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.890
Kidnapping and holding
a man like him captive?

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:03.260
And for that, I was beaten half to death
by the thugs the chairman sent.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.830
That's because you deserved it.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.300
Besides, I did it for Min Kyung Chae,
your sister.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:12.070
Anyway, this isn't the time
to argue about that.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.710
If you want to protect the company,
just do as your sister says.

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:16.540
Hurry up and transfer your stake to her,

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.810
and support her
at the shareholders' meeting...

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:20.140
to approve the chairman's suspension.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:29.020
Gosh, who does that brat think he is,
telling me what to do?

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.220
I was going to do that anyway.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.330
Gosh, seriously!
He's just the absolute worst.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:41.100
- Who's the absolute worst?
- Just some guy.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.600
So, why are you being so quiet?

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.240
Looks like the shareholders' meeting
is going to be held this week.

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:49.710
Since you won't pick a side,
Kyung Chae keeps calling me.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:52.480
Why? Is Kyung Chae getting nervous?

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.010
You...

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.650
Don't tell me you're planning on
siding with that woman.

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:58.650
We'll see.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:03.220
What do you mean, "we'll see?"
Like it or not, we have to stick together.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.320
I wonder.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.320
That woman and Kyung Chae,
they're all the same to me.

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.890
Hey, listen to yourself.
How can they possibly be the same?

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.560
You and Kyung Chae are
at least half-sisters.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:17.300
Anyway, I'll figure it out on my own.
You just worry about yourself.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:18.940
Just make sure you don't regret
your choices later.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.080
If Moon Tae Kyung's parents' contract
isn't in here,

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.010
then why on earth was it locked?

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.920
But there might at least be a clue inside.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.560
Well, what do you know?
The chairman's office really suits you.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.000
How dare you show your face here?

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:50.000
Not after what you did to the chairman.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.970
They say the position makes the person.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.970
Sitting in that chair must make you
feel all high and mighty.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:56.610
And now you're lecturing me. How nice.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:01.040
Have you no shame?
You kidnapped and jailed the chairman...

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.410
Are you forgetting that Chairman Min
tried to take me out first?

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.520
My life was on the line.
Did you expect me to just take it?

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.020
And why do you think
the chairman would do that?

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.560
Because the dog bit the hand that fed it.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.890
That's just like you.
It's always someone else's fault.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.630
You never take responsibility
for your own actions.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:24.070
Mark my words.
You'll die blaming everyone but yourself.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.620
I guess you're not curious
why the chairman collapsed.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.580
I'd think you'd be curious,
but you're not asking.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:46.120
Well, that usually means
one of two things.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.330
Either you couldn't care less
what happens to the chairman,

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.960
or...

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:53.130
you already know the real reason
he collapsed.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.030
Then why did he collapse?

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.300
What's so funny?

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:05.280
Moon Tae Kyung, you're a fascinating guy.
And an exceptional actor, too.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.880
Anyway, his health is a sore subject,
so let's just drop it.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.350
Besides, we'll know soon enough.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:15.820
Who the true owner of Mingang is.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.390
An outsider shouldn't be running the show,
now should they?

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:32.940
Yes, Madam.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.400
What's the update?

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:36.540
Did the shareholders' meeting notice
go out today?

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.040
No, not yet.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.080
But from the way Kim Sun Jae is acting,

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:42.850
I think it'll be today or tomorrow.

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:45.680
Then you should
go see Oh Pan Sool today...

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:47.780
and seal the deal.

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:52.720
It's a war in the owner family for now,
but it's about to be an all-out battle.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.590
We need to make our move
before that happens.

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:56.830
Here you go.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.800
- Enjoy your meal!
- Thank you.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:02.770
(Chunbokjib Black Goat)

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.970
- Welcome.
- Oh my goodness! Look who it is.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.340
- What brings you all the way out here?
- Did you know this was our place?

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.240
Of course. I knew you two were running it,
so I made a point to come.

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.480
I should have come much sooner,
but I'm only just making it now.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.880
My apologies.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.810
Don't be silly.
We're just glad you could make it.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.980
So, what do you think? Nice place, right?

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.920
Hey, stop showing off and get him a menu.
The man must be starving.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.990
Oh, where is my mind?
Right. Here you go. What would you like?

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.260
I'll have whatever you recommend.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.900
No, not just anything.
You're a special guest.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.000
I'll recommend the most delicious
and restorative dish we have.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.300
Just a second. Let's see here.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:42.010
Why pick one? Bring everything delicious.
You, get ready to test your limits today.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:44.540
You've never eaten until you burst, right?
Today's your lucky day.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.410
- Go on, get it already!
- All right, all right!

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.880
What really brings you here?

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:51.150
I doubt this is just a social call.

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.720
Actually, sir, I have
some information for you.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.690
Information? What kind of information?

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.590
I think something big is about to happen,
and before the stock price plummets,

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:03.590
You should consider selling your stake
in Mingang Distribution.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.560
What? I hoped you'd be the one to burst,
not the company.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.100
Good grief, my head is going to explode.
What is it?

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.540
Tae Kyung must be meeting with
Oh Pan Sool right now.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:19.040
When you get home,
start working on Min Soo Jung.

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:21.450
She holds a grudge against her sister,

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:24.010
so it'll be tough for her
to take her side.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.920
What are you doing in my room?

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.990
Just wondering what you were up to.

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:42.000
I doubt you're really curious about that.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.670
What do you really want?

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.940
Fine. I'll be straight with you.

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:54.410
An emergency
shareholders' meeting is soon,

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:56.780
and your sister will ask
for my suspension.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.880
So, you want me to stop it?

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:04.220
Basically, you want me to vote my shares
with you instead of my sister, right?

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.390
That's right. That's why I'm here.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:09.260
Why would I do that?

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.630
Because Kyung Chae and I are always
at each other's throats?

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:17.000
You know she's to blame for your mother.
Siding with her after that is ridiculous.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:18.600
I thought I made it clear.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:23.940
I'm not siding with Kyung Chae,
but that doesn't mean I'm siding with you.

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:31.050
Hey.

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.150
I know it's not my place to say this,

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:36.090
but aren't you being a little too obvious?

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.820
- Obvious about what?
- Do you know why we're called Mingang?

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:43.490
It stands for "the mighty company
of the Mins."

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.960
It's a bit much for a non-Min
to be acting so entitled.

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:52.270
Isn't it embarrassing when your bloodline
is all you have going for you?

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.210
That's usually what incompetent people
fall back on.

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:10.020
Hey, when are you going to call for
the shareholders' meeting?

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.660
If you're going to do it, do it now.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:13.290
What's the sudden rush?

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:17.790
She's going to ruin everything.
I just saw Lucia leave Soo Jung's room.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.400
What was she doing in there?

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:23.830
What do you think?
She's trying to get Soo Jung on her side.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:28.510
I'll back you up no matter what this time,
so you'd better show her who's boss.

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:31.880
Don't worry. The official notice
for the meeting goes up tomorrow.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.280
(Notice of
Emergency Shareholders' Meeting)

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.320
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:40.950
(Mingang Distribution)

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.530
Been busy calling
the shareholders' meeting?

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.490
Staying busy even after you were fired.

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:53.000
I suppose I am.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.000
I'd like to get some rest,
but some people won't let me.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.340
Are you starting to grasp
the situation now?

00:24:58.700 --> 00:24:59.970
Now I see.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:03.010
Just how precarious my position is.

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:04.640
Good. As long as you understand.

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.040
It's important to know your place.

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.680
- I'll see you at home.
- Let's talk in the chairman's office.

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:16.650
This could be our last chance.
I'll have to leave once I'm suspended.

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:18.290
Let's talk one last time.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:22.290
Fine.

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.650
What's this final matter?

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.750
There's something I need to confirm.

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:53.390
When I'm suspended from my acting duties
and this seat is vacant,

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.090
who are you going to put in charge?

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:57.530
Is that why you wanted to talk?

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:02.570
The chairman's bylaws state that
all executives must be family members,

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:07.170
and the CEO and chairman positions
are specifically for his children.

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:09.940
Isn't it only natural that I'd be curious
who's next in line?

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:12.380
That's for me to worry about,
so mind your own business.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.780
So, is it Director Min and Vice Director?

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.280
Who are you talking about?

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.150
You mean Soo Jung and Ji Seop?

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:22.520
Who else is there?

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:26.460
Of course, things would be different
if you became the majority shareholder,

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.890
but as of now, they're both contenders,
aren't they?

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:33.600
I, for one, hope Vice Director gets it.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:37.070
He just hasn't been given a chance.
He'd do a great job if you let him.

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:39.070
You're so clueless.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:42.310
Ji Seop is in way over his head
with the position he has now.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.280
He's always making trouble
or disappearing.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.080
I've lost count of the ventures
he's ruined.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:51.250
You shouldn't talk about him like that.
He is on your side, you know.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.650
That's about as useful as he gets.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:58.020
Based purely on merit, he'd be back
working the floor at one of our stores.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.490
Anyway, stop worrying about all that
and take a hard look at your own reality.

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.610
What are you doing here?

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:18.610
Kyung Chae, you...

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:43.070
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:00.650
You horrible woman.
How could you do this to me?

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:04.020
Make sure his stake ends up in my hands.
Do I make myself clear?

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.320
Stop acting so high and mighty.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.520
And why don't you take off your mask?

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:09.060
You think I don't know who you are?

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:11.390
I'd say that's a pretty good offer,
wouldn't you?

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:15.270
This is the moment
the majority shareholder changes.

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:19.670
