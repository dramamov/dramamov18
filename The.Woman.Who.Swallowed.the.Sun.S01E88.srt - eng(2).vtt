00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.810
(Episode 88)

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.760
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.060
My name is Kim Sun Jae,
and I'm going to marry Min Kyung Chae.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.230
I'm sure I need no further introduction.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.240
I look forward to getting
to know you, Brother-in-law.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.840
And to my new sisters-in-law,
I hope we get along.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.280
And you as well, Mother.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.420
I've always heard that a good son-in-law
is a treasure to his mother-in-law.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.590
I hope you'll grow very fond of me.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.960
Mother.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.530
If you're done, let's go
to the dining room. Dinner is ready.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.010
What a spread, Manager Gong!

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.480
Where should I start?

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.750
I don't know when you two got so close,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.080
but do you have to do this now
when the chairman is missing?

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.050
That's why we're only having
an engagement party.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.120
Without knowing where my father is
or how he's doing,

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.420
I don't exactly feel like
prancing around in a wedding dress.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.690
I'm just really curious.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.600
How did your relationship
get this serious?

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.500
Is this an arranged marriage or something?

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.040
That's a hurtful thing to say,
Brother-in-law.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.710
Wasn't it your marriage that was arranged?

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.840
That's not true, Sun Jae!

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.910
Wait.
Is he my sister-in-law's husband now?

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.550
We were in love.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.150
Don't assume all arranged marriages
are the same.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.160
You're sorely mistaken!

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.760
So even with the chairman missing,

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.460
you're still going through with it?

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.130
Why shouldn't we?

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.170
You're unbelievable.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.070
I'm starting to feel sorry
for the chairman.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.440
How could you all be like this?

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.110
You'd be more upset if a pet dog ran away.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.040
This is the chairman we're talking about!

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.250
My father-in-law is a lucky man
to have someone worry about him so much.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:22.850
I'm quite envious.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.050
Please share some of that love
with me too, Mother.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.820
As I said, a son-in-law is
a mother-in-law's favorite.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.190
- Isn't that right, Mother?
- Stop calling me that!

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.730
Can't you stop calling me that?

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.700
How else should I address you...

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.570
when you'll be my mother-in-law, Mother?

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.460
She seemed to flinch every time you call
her "mother-in-law."

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.660
I'm doing it on purpose.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.300
That way, she'll get sick of it and leave.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.670
I didn't know you thought that far ahead.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.140
I told you before.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.140
When it comes to you officially
becoming the chairman...

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.070
and the new owner of Mingang,
there's nothing I wouldn't do.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.310
That's very reassuring to hear.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.780
So, when and where
is the engagement party?

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.180
I'll take care of it.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.020
I'll let you know when it's decided,
so just wait.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.850
I'm a little tired today.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.990
Why don't you head home now?

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.830
Of course.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.490
You don't want to be tired
for work tomorrow.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.270
Don't see me out.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.870
I can see myself out.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.440
All right, then.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.340
See you at work tomorrow.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.680
She really just left like that?

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.630
Stop right there!

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.770
You're marrying Min Kyung Chae?

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.500
Are you out of your mind?

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.870
Actually, I've never been more sane.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.280
Do you really think this makes any sense?

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.050
If you have any decency,
there are lines you shouldn't cross.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.550
You and I lived together
and even had a child together.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.620
So how could you even think
of becoming my son-in-law?

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.120
How can you so shamelessly
call me your mother-in-law?

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.830
If it bothers you, stop being
the mother-in-law. Problem solved.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.730
Baek Sul Hee, you'll never
get your revenge. You know why?

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.800
Because I'm right here by your side,

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.470
and I know you and your plans too well.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.810
So just give it up
and go back to where you belong.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.310
Frankly, now that the old chairman
is out of the picture,

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.110
what are you going to do
hanging around here?

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.920
I'm only saying this for old times' sake,

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.050
so you'd better listen.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:16.550
Well then...

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.490
Your future son-in-law
will take his leave now.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.960
Dear mother...

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:23.860
in-law!

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.040
Darn.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.470
That crazy little...

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.280
(CEO Jung Lucia)

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.220
It's me.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.390
It seems Min Kyung Chae and Kim Sun Jae...

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.900
- are getting married.
- What?

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.570
Who's getting married to whom?

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.440
What kind of nonsense is this?
Is it really true?

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.170
It's true. He came to our house yesterday
to introduce himself.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.580
I've seen everything now.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.180
It's not entirely unexpected.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.750
Kim Sun Jae always wanted
to marry Min Kyung Chae...

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.150
to become part of the owner's family.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.890
That's not what I meant.
I'm just worried about you.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.090
You're about to become mother-in-law
to that awful ex-boyfriend of yours.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.530
Will you be okay?
Can you stand the sight of him?

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.070
- He's going to be even more insufferable.
- What can I do?

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.600
Right now, finding Chairman Min
is more important.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.310
That's true.
Let them do whatever they want.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.580
We need to find Min Doo Sik first.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.850
Min Kyung Chae,
so you've forgotten my Ho Se...

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.090
and moved on to another man?

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.120
The only reason
I've put up with you until now...

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.890
was because you couldn't forget my son
and remained single for all those years.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.830
But this changes everything.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.210
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.380
I see you're wearing a ring
I haven't seen before.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.280
I didn't know you were so observant,
Director Moon.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.550
It's an engagement ring.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.150
From Lawyer Kim.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.260
- Lawyer Kim Sun Jae?
- Is there another Lawyer Kim?

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.020
Then...

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.290
Did you accept his proposal?

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.530
Is there a reason I shouldn't?

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.100
Do you not know what kind of person he is?

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.800
Why would you make that decision...

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.700
Since when were you so concerned about me?

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.640
When I was removed as CEO...

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.810
and demoted to a regular employee
of the Online Business Team,

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.940
- I'll never forget how you treated me.
- That was...

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.550
I had no other choice.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.320
Even if I could go back,
I would do the same thing.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.260
I still believe that I was doing
what was best for my team.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.160
True.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.790
That stubbornness is part of your charm.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.660
You should've been this nice to me
a long time ago.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.670
I believe I gave you several chances.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.300
What do you mean...

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.670
Not as your CEO,

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.640
but as a woman to a man,

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.740
I gave you several chances.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.710
But every single time,
the one who rejected me...

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.950
was you, Moon Tae Kyung.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.530
I hear you're marrying Ms. Min.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.840
She's been the acting chairman
for a while now.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.900
Why are you still calling her "Ms. Min?"

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.570
Can't you use the proper title?

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:59.540
- So you've finally achieved your dream?
- What's wrong?

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.750
Am I not allowed to achieve my dream?

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.720
Even a dragon can come
from the humblest beginnings.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:08.790
A person's environment is important,

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.020
but it's not everything.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.790
It's a shame that your strong will
wasn't put to better use.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.530
What are you talking about?

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.370
If you're jealous, just say so.
It's more human.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.440
If this were the old days,
it'd be like I'm becoming the king's man.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.000
Of course, you'd be jealous.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.040
I'm not sure
there's a reason to be jealous.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.310
And with the chairman gone,

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.110
must you rush such a major event?

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.950
There you go again with that lecturing.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.650
Such a typical boomer.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.990
Anyway, with a happy event ahead of me,

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.320
I'll be generous and tolerate it.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:45.760
What exactly are you tolerating?

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.560
Haven't we had our share of arguments?

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:50.960
But they all happened
while we were each working hard...

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.630
doing our jobs, so...

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.570
I'm saying I forgive everything.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:57.870
You forgive me?

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.340
Yes, I do.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.240
Not knowing I was about to level up
and join the owner's family,

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.940
you acted high and mighty in front of me,

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.450
but I'll forgive everything.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.160
Your sins...

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.090
are forgiven.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.550
Do you know that Kim Sun Jae
and Min Kyung Chae are getting married?

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.550
It looks like they are about to start
working as a team in earnest.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.860
Once they marry, Kim Sun Jae's shares
will go directly to Min Kyung Chae.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.590
I suppose so. That's the only way...

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.560
to defend their management rights
against any variables.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.000
You said one month, right?

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.660
That we have to find
Chairman Min Doo Sik within a month?

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.770
- Yes.
- Then to take back...

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:04.570
their management rights,

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.940
we must rescue Chairman Min Doo Sik...

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.910
and get his shares.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.080
I would give whoever gets me
out of here...

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.880
all of Mingang Distribution
without a second thought.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:21.750
I don't care who it is.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.120
Please, someone, find me.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.060
Please.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.500
Or this will be
where I, Min Doo Sik, lie to rest.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:47.780
Why is there so much stuff?

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.480
She just collects it
and never throws anything away.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.850
Ms. Se Ri,
bring anything you want to throw away.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.790
We'll toss it all
when we clean the storage.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.520
Manager Gong, how can you be
in the right mind to do this now?

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.560
Aren't you worried about Dad?

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.260
You're acting like you know where he is.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.030
What would I know?

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.000
As for the chairman...

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.370
Ms. Kyung Chae said
she hired people to look for him.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.710
I should gather more
and do it all at once later.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.980
I should hurry and prepare
for Ms. Kyung Chae's engagement.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.880
But I don't like Lawyer Kim.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.480
This is Ms. Kyung Chae's decision.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.990
I don't know about anyone else,
but at least you should support her.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.660
What? That brat Sun Jae
is getting married?

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.400
And to your eldest sister-in-law?

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:47.000
I'm telling you, he is.
He came to greet us all, and it was chaos.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.910
My goodness. How can he get married...

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.040
without a single word to his only aunt?

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.580
I'm his only living blood relative.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.510
Is that anything new?

00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.480
That brat Sun Jae lost all his manners
a long time ago.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:04.120
Still, this is too much.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:09.830
What will I tell my sister
when I meet her in the afterlife?

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.600
What nonsense are you spouting?

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:17.940
How would you meet her? She'll be
in a place of honor for being good,

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.940
while you'll be barely hanging on
at the edge of ruin.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.170
What? Are you finished?
You handsome old geezer!

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:26.780
Why are you two like this?
He was just trying to cheer you up, Mom.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.480
Dad was only joking.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:32.950
I have to go see Sun Jae.
He can ignore everyone else, but not me.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.790
How can he be all alone at the wedding?

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.150
Is he trying to show off he's an orphan?

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.190
- Stop it.
- Mom, don't.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.260
He won't see you just because you show up.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:42.930
Do you not know what Sun Jae is like?

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:47.730
Yes, Ja Kyung is right about that.
He's a heartless, cold, and cruel guy.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.940
Even if you visit him a thousand times,
he'll ignore you and refuse to see you.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.070
So I can't even go to
my only nephew's wedding?

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:55.770
This is all messed up!

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.190
We need to talk. Come to my office.

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.030
(Mingang Distribution)

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:17.130
What is it now?

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.900
Give up on marrying Min Kyung Chae.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.770
Please, let's not get tangled up together.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:30.810
I'm already part of the Min family,
but you can still get away.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.580
You've got some nerve.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.650
Why is it okay for you but not for me?

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.250
Frankly, I'm in a better position.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:44.220
You married an old man 20 years older
and became his fourth wife.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.860
I'm marrying a woman with no children
who has never been married.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:48.490
What did you say?

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.960
Min Kyung Chae
is fundamentally different...

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.770
from a shameless woman like you,
who lies to everyone around her...

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.640
and had a child the father didn't want.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.640
Do you hear me?

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:02.470
If I'm shameless,
Min Kyung Chae is even worse.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:07.410
At least I registered my daughter as mine,
not someone else's.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.450
What are you talking about?

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.380
Min Kyung Chae, the woman you worship?

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.050
She secretly had another man's child
and registered the baby as her father's.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.020
She's pretending to be
the child's half-sister.

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:22.460
Hard to believe, isn't it?

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:24.730
But what can you do...

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.100
when it's the truth?

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.370
That's ridiculous.
Are you making up a cheap soap opera plot?

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.170
Min Se Ri...

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:34.040
is Min Kyung Chae's real daughter.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:36.770
She had her in secret 20 years ago...

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.510
and passed her off
as Chairman Min Doo Sik's own child!

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:41.780
You must be desperate.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.120
If you don't want to be my mother-in-law,
then leave.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.420
Why are you making up lies?

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.920
Don't believe me if you don't want to.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.960
Go ahead and be a fool,
trusting a woman who has deceived you.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:57.060
Just think about how overprotective
Kyung Chae has been...

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.230
with her so-called sister, Se Ri.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:15:59.560
See if it all adds up.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:04.940
So call off the wedding.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.710
Min Kyung Chae?
She doesn't intend to give you her heart.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.180
Would she genuinely care about you
when she already has a biological child?

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:17.750
And she'll leave her company and fortune
to Se Ri.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.950
There won't be a single penny for you.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.620
That's motherly love.

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.090
I know that feeling...

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:26.620
better than anyone.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.540
Baek Sul Hee, you think I'd believe you?

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.240
What kind of cheap, made-up drama is that?

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.780
Let's say Min Kyung Chae
had an intense first love...

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:48.650
and that she had a thing with the guy
who drew her portrait.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.750
But how can she spout such nonsense
that Se Ri is Kyung Chae's daughter?

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:57.620
What on earth...

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:00.420
is Ms. Se Ri to you?

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.430
Both your younger sisters.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.060
Aren't they the same to the chairman?

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.130
They're both illegitimate,
yet you treat them differently.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.000
Se Ri is changing day by day.

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:12.340
She's becoming too dependent
on that woman.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.770
Well, Se Ri is the bigger problem,
not my father.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:19.980
Right now, I want her gone more
for Se Ri's sake than for my father's.

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.080
So what are you so worried about now?

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:24.680
That I'm going to lose her.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.020
What's the use? She has it all.

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:31.460
The CEO position, the company shares,
and the chairman's favor.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:35.530
And even Se Ri.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:38.700
No way.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.140
Yes.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:50.610
Right now?

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:08.090
Let's just have a meal with our families
instead of a formal engagement ceremony.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.630
This weekend at two o'clock,
at the Sereno Hotel.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:12.560
Can I ask you one thing?

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:14.430
What is it?

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:15.870
Ms. Se Ri...

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.070
What does she mean to you?

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.770
Didn't I tell you?

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:22.970
She's special to me.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.540
I've told you more than once.
Why are you asking all of a sudden?

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:30.680
Then what would you do
if something were to happen to Se Ri?

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.320
I don't even want to think about it,

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.050
but if something happened to her,
I wouldn't be able to live.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:39.590
And I'd never forgive the one responsible.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.990
Isn't that a bit of an overreaction?

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.360
Anyone would think you're her mother,
not her sister.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.600
She's like a daughter to me.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.270
She's as precious to me as Mingang.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.240
She's as precious as Mingang?

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.240
So...

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.940
You should be good to Se Ri too, Mr. Kim.

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.550
Treat her even better than you treat me.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.010
Think of yourself...

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:07.750
not as her brother-in-law,
but as her father.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:17.560
Is that so?

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:19.630
That's actually for the best.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.370
You needed to have at least one flaw.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.100
That way, you can't go back
on your word later.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.940
You were always so perfect
and untouchable.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.840
But now I've finally found your weakness.

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:38.520
This weekend?

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.520
It seems a little sudden,

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:45.390
but if it's what you wish,
Ms. Kyung Chae, so be it.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:49.430
I'll make the arrangements.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:50.930
Saturday, the Sereno Hotel.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.870
It moves me deeply to be able...

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.340
to see your engagement ceremony,
Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:01.140
Kyung Chae's engagement party?

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.080
Vice Director Min.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:10.080
No, wait. This is personal,
so I'll call you my brother-in-law.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:13.620
Ji Seop, just so you know,
Kyung Chae and I...

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:16.920
are getting engaged this weekend
at the Sereno Hotel.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.060
Did you call her Kyung Chae?

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.430
And what? You're getting engaged?

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:25.330
This isn't something
that can be whipped up.

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:26.700
What's the big rush?

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.970
We should take care of it
while we're on the topic.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:30.000
She may be the acting chairman,

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.300
but she still has a lot on her plate.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.270
And Director Moon,

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.470
if you have time,
you should come and congratulate us...

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.110
and enjoy a meal with us.

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.360
(Mingang Distribution)

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.360
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.780
You don't seem very happy to see me.

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:19.480
Well, did you expect me
to welcome you with open arms?

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:23.150
We're not exactly on those terms, are we?

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:25.160
That's true.

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:27.490
But regardless of anyone else,

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:30.660
I felt I had to come
and tell you, Ms. Jang.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.330
This weekend,

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.430
Kyung Chae and I are getting engaged
at the Sereno Hotel.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.470
I'd like you to come and grace the event
with your presence if you have time.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.240
Why would you invite me
when we're not even close?

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.240
Don't you know what it means
better than anyone?

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:48.080
It means that Min Kyung Chae
is my woman now.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.950
And that I have no intention
of letting another man have her.

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:53.250
Lingering feelings...

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.750
are only for when the person
is still alive.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.320
Isn't that right?

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.560
Well then, I'll see you there.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:14.500
Is he trying to rub salt in my wounds?

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:29.490
What's the point of having kids...

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:32.160
when none of them are
even trying to find out...

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.920
whether their father is dead or alive.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.330
Lucia.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.730
You have to find me.

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.140
At this rate, I'm going to die.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.070
Lucia.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.510
Lucia.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:56.780
Lucia...

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:31.010
You have one month.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.420
If my father doesn't return in a month,

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.120
don't forget you promised
to leave on your own.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:51.330
Kim Sun Jae invited me himself.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.640
The nerve of him.

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:57.240
He was probably concerned
about Min Kyung Chae's ex-boyfriend.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:02.150
He may not have proof, but he must suspect
Jung Ho Se is your son.

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:05.420
He was probably trying to brag.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:09.850
He told me Min Kyung Chae is
his woman now. Unbelievable.

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:12.390
Who knew I'd see the day
when I'd be invited...

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:13.960
to my son's ex-girlfriend's
engagement party?

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.130
How messed up is that?

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:20.060
I know. It's so childish of him
to invite you.

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.640
The traffic department just checked
the traffic cameras from that day.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.310
We've confirmed the route
Chairman Min's sedan took.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.640
You did?

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.610
Where is it? Let's go together.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:37.280
I'm going too.

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:44.960
The engagement party is soon.
You should go home and rest today.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.890
I have too many urgent documents
to review right now.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:54.130
Don't worry.
The engagement will happen no matter what.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.830
I'm not worried about the party
being canceled.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:59.870
I'm worried about my woman.
You look tired.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.500
Your woman?

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.440
I can take care of myself,
so you can go home.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.680
All right. I'll head out first.

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.450
Don't overwork yourself.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.160
She must be having second thoughts
about the engagement.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.830
Min Kyung Chae.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.600
I can never let you go. Not after
I worked so hard for this chance.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.880
Can I see you for a moment?

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:46.350
No.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:49.290
Your eldest sister asked me
to take good care of you.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.490
To treat you even better than I treat her.

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.360
She said I should treat you...

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.960
like a daughter
rather than my sister-in-law.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.130
- Did she really say that?
- Of course.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.800
That's why I'm trying my best,
so come meet me.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:16.150
Why do you insist on meeting
when I said no?

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:18.480
Since you're here, just eat.

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.120
You ordered without even asking.

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:26.190
- Why are you speaking to me casually?
- Can't I?

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.990
I'm about to be your brother-in-law.

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:29.490
Actually, your father.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:31.590
Since I'm your mother's man.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.000
Brother-in-law? Please.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.270
You never know with a couple
until they're at the altar.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.140
You must be hungry. Go ahead and eat.

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:45.810
If you don't eat,

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:47.480
I'll call your big sister over.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:03.290
You need to listen to me
and we have to get along...

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.560
so I can tame Min Kyung Chae.

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:08.030
After all, you're now my trophy.

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:23.280
Are you left-handed?

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:26.550
Why do you ask?

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.920
Is there a problem?

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:30.150
No, not at all.

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:31.990
It’s just that I am, too.

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:47.570
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:05.520
Meeting Se Ri today made me determined
to proceed with the marriage.

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:07.720
Oddly enough,
she doesn't feel like a stranger.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.960
What did you just say?

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:10.660
What makes you any different?

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:14.360
Once they're engaged, the world is theirs.
What could possibly stop them?

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.970
I can't be pushed aside like this.

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:17.270
Has anyone else contacted you?

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:20.700
Chairman Min must be trying to escape
using any means he can.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.140
I heard you took Se Ri out.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.980
Even if Se Ri is your secret daughter,
I'm okay with it.

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:29.410
