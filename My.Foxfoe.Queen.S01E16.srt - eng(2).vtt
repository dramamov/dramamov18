00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.180
(It's late.)

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.500
(Xiling Heng is not in his bedchambers.)

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.700
(What is he still doing
in the imperial study?)

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.220
Your Highness.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.739
His Majesty is handling state affairs
in the imperial study.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.220
No outsiders may intrude.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.300
Am I an outsider too?

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.539
His Majesty has given orders.
This is a matter of utmost secrecy.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.379
No one is to disturb,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.740
including Your Highness.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.700
(Never mind.)

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.460
(I'll ask him another time.)

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.579
I've slain

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.340
586 Mount Yao rabbit demons.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.060
Their inner cores are all here.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.620
Please examine them.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.260
That's such a small number.
It's not nearly enough.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.100
Have you wiped out

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.460
all the demons in Mount Yao?

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.540
Why won't you answer me?

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.299
Aren't you curious

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.420
why I specifically ordered you
to kill the Mount Yao demons?

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.100
Because that's your old home.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.979
You and your filthy mother

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.860
both came from there.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.060
Only if you kill those demons

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.020
will I feel satisfied.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.740
Don't you feel the same?

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.020
Why won't you answer me?

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.060
Answer me!

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.140
I've slain

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.060
586 Mount Yao rabbit demons.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.900
Their inner cores are all here.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.460
Please examine them.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.779
If only your filthy mother

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.660
could see you like this.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.900
Too bad you already killed her.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.260
By any means necessary,

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.539
slaughter all Mount Yao demons

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.499
within three days.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.620
Understood.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.820
(What happened at Mount Yao?)

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.659
(Has something happened?)

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.740
Your Highness.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.740
Did you find him?

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.339
I've searched all the places Lord Wing
has been these past few days.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.700
No sign of him.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.979
It's like he vanished into thin air.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.500
(What in the world is going on?)

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.700
(I have a bad feeling about this.)

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.819
Seize that demon!

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.939
Don't let it get away!

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.260
Search over there!

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.740
What's going on?

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.579
Your Highness.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.419
A demon suddenly burst into the palace.
We're trying to capture it.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.179
It's dangerous here.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.619
Please return to your palace.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.539
Is that demon injured?

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.059
Yes.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.340
Did Your Highness see it?

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.540
I saw it head that way.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.660
Let's go.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.820
Your Highness, we should head back.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.740
We'll be fine.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.179
Your Highness.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.260
We shouldn't go there, Your Highness.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.660
Your Highness.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.140
It's all right.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.740
Youyou?

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.020
Do you know her?

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.659
She's a friend from my old home.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.259
Come on.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.739
Help me carry her inside.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.860
Yes.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.579
Your Highness,
here's the medicine you wanted.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.020
I've brought it for you.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.660
Good.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.179
Go get some rest.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.940
I'll manage.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.299
Don't worry.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.580
I'll be fine.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.380
Yes, Your Highness.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.340
Youyou.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.340
Youyou!

00:05:41.425 --> 00:05:42.739
(Youyou, Deer Demon)

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.660
(Youyou, Deer Demon)
You... You're...

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.500
It's me.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.860
Tushan Yue.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.100
Tushan Yue?

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.980
Isn't she already...

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.700
I drank the fox clan's holy water

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.580
and only a wisp of my soul remained,

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.900
so I possessed this body you see now.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.219
Easy there.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.500
Yue.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.220
Yue.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.340
Is it really you?

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.180
Yue...

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.580
Youyou.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.100
Youyou, don't cry.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.339
Tell me,

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.980
what happened at Mount Yao?

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.980
How did you get injured so badly?

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.179
Yue,

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.500
three days ago,

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.739
a man appeared at Mount Yao

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.460
and went on a slaughtering spree.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.139
His body heals itself.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.580
None of us could stop him.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.940
(It's Xiling Xuan.)

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.660
In the end,

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.700
he killed many demons.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.900
I'm the only survivor

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.900
of the deer demon clan.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.380
It's all right.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.100
It's all right now, Youyou.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.059
Tell me,

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.100
how did you end up here?

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.540
I followed that man all the way here.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.660
I wanted to take revenge,

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.380
but the guards caught sight of me,

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.300
so I hid.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.979
I was wounded too badly

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.900
and passed out.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.899
I must kill him

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.299
to avenge my clan.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.179
Youyou, listen to me.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.419
Calm down.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.380
You've been severely wounded.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.739
You need rest.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.140
I will take care

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.740
of the revenge.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.019
No.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.259
He killed my entire clan.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.979
I have to finish him myself!

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.859
You're hurt badly at the moment.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.460
If you go,
you'll just be walking to your death.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.659
You know where he is, don't you?

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.219
Take me to him!

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.219
Calm down,

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.420
Youyou...

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.859
Youyou!

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.140
Lie down.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.700
Lie down. Slowly.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.179
Youyou,

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:03.859
listen to me.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.579
Rest and heal now.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.900
I promise

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.780
I will avenge all the demons.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.220
You're safe.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.660
Wait here.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.340
I'll get you some more medicine.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.740
I'll be right back.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.340
Youyou?

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.660
Youyou?

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.780
I'll kill you!

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.140
Youyou!

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.060
Youyou!
