I'm ready.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.440
- We're good to go.
- All set?

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.120
Okay. Are we ready to roll?

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.600
Speed!

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.680
Hello.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.120
You're watching 'Spooky Hellish Night, '

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.560
a fiery night haunted
by horrors of the unknown.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.280
I'm Phloengnathitorn.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.920
We're joined by Jaab,
the person behind this EP's story.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.856
To make it even more special,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.360
this EP's also featuring
the White Knight Seer,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.040
a clairvoyance expert.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.840
Hello, Master.
Hello, Jaab.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.400
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.960
Why is this room full of the scent of summer?

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.080
My senses are completely clouded...

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.480
Jaab,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.200
I heard you've had an experience with a curse.
Is that correct?

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.360
That's right. I was cursed,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.800
and I think that I still am.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.240
And...

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.320
What's the story?

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.600
Do you mind sharing it with us?

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.520
Well, I'm superstitious.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.200
It all started
when I broke up with my boyfriend.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.160
I wanted him to come back to me,

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.920
so I turned to the paranormal.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.480
This generation
is into such things, aren't they?

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.840
So where did you go for that?

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.240
Horrorscope.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.320
Sorry?

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.880
It's the name of the place.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.600
It's a shop offering good luck wallpapers.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.760
Are you alright, Master?

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.600
No, it was nothing.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.080
So, what is it with Horrorscope?

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.720
They let me choose
aspects of my luck to enhance.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.600
There's career, finance, and love.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.160
So I chose love,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.600
since I'd like him to come back to me.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.840
- I really love him.
- Right.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.080
Why Horrorscope?

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.240
I mean, there are several of
these shops out there on social media.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.120
Is there a specific reason
you chose this place?

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.680
I love the slogan:

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.040
"Visit Horrorscope

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.280
and your life will be horrible no more."

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.200
Master?

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.080
It's nothing.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.680
Does this mean their fortune reading
is very accurate?

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.280
It's 99%, Phloeng!

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.840
The reading is 99% accurate?

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.320
99% comes from my own actions,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.480
and 1% from the wallpaper.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.280
Master?

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.360
You don't look so well.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.480
Is it because of Jaab?

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.560
Oh, it's not.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.200
Please continue.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.040
So, two months ago,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.040
my boyfriend started acting strange.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.600
He came home late,

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.160
always dodged my questions,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.120
and always stayed in the bedroom.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.080
He would wake up
in the middle of every night

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.160
and stare at the window.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.280
Babe?

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.800
Are you alright?

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.480
Still, he wasn't the same.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.000
On some nights, he'd get on top of me,

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.520
and just stay still!

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.480
It was so terrifying.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.040
It was as if he were cursed.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.240
Huh? Babe?

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.840
What are you doing?!

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.800
Babe!

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.800
A new scent?

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.120
What does this mean?

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.600
Do you think
his boyfriend has also been cursed?

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.480
Maybe that wallpaper works
the same way as a philter.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.720
It's possible.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.800
From my own experiences

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.720
with those charmed by a spell,

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.600
they all look unwell, just like him.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.840
Now, it's your turn, Master.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.760
Yes?

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.880
Oh.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.320
Then...
Please select three cards from the deck

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.680
with your non-dominant hand.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.720
Regarding your question...

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.800
The Major Arcana I picked is
accompanied by two Minor Arcana,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.760
Five of Pentacles and Two of Pentacles.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.000
The Major Arcana is the Devil.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.680
Usually, the Pentacles cards resemble wealth.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.160
It can also be interpreted as prosperity

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.280
and physical well-being.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.000
When the Pentacles cards
appear with the Devil...

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.520
What does it mean, Master?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Yes, what does it mean?

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.680
What's Jaab's fortune like?

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.440
I cannot interpret them...

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.920
What?

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.320
So...

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.680
Has your boyfriend given you
any suspicious drinks lately?

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.800
For one, he's brewed me tea.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.040
He said he got it from India.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.280
Master, don't tell me that...

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.640
Do you go to bed before him

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.320
or after him?

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.400
I always sleep before him.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.760
And...

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.640
How's your finance?

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.200
Any irregularities with your finances?

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.960
Yes, I've been spending a lot of money.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.320
I've been getting all the supplies
for our room myself.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.680
He used to help me with this,

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.480
but not anymore.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.880
Moreover, I feel like
I'm constantly bleeding money.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.160
I don't know why that's the case either.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.040
I don't know...

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.480
What the hell?

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.560
How do I get back?

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.640
You can't.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.960
Who are you?

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.760
I'm the one in your vision, honey.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.560
Win...

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.760
Wongsawat!

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.360
Master!

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.520
Are you alright?

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.800
Is it a ghost?

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.320
Phloeng?

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.400
What just happened?

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.720
Please give me a moment.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.760
Jaab,

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.440
do you have any valuable possessions,

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.800
like a family ring,

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.400
passed down from your grandfather?

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.960
I do. My mother gave me something.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.720
However, I don't wear it.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.680
I'd keep it in my pocket instead.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.160
It's a family heirloom that belonged to
my great-great-grandmother.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.400
It must be a priceless item, then.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.480
Do you mind if I have a look?

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.040
It's actually worth
a few hundred thousand baht.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.440
I must've forgotten to bring it with me today.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.000
If possible,

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.400
please hurry and find it.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.400
Why?

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.400
Is his bracelet the key to easing his troubles?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.840
It's not related to a curse at all.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.040
Huh?

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.480
Jaab,

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.120
can you please check your bank account?

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.040
Why, Master?

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.640
Please do it.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.760
What?!

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.680
What's the problem?

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.720
Is it a ghost?

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.640
There's nothing left in my bank account!

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.120
Huh?

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.440
It's empty!

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.840
Pull yourself together, Jaab.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.040
Think carefully,

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.480
if you've spent it on something

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.720
or transferred the money
to any other bank accounts.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.640
No, I never use this account ever!

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.000
I've never taken any money out of it.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.280
It's my hands-off bank account.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.320
And...

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.120
Can anybody else access this bank account?

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.360
No.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.840
I've never used this bank account,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.896
and I've never once
transferred the money from it.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.320
It's completely inaccessible!

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.120
And...

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.800
Is there anyone else
you think can access this account?

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.640
Aside from me,

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.120
it's probably my boyfriend.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.160
Okay, then it's clear.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.720
You weren't cursed.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.160
But scammed.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.320
Let's go, Yok.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.760
Follow me.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.280
You're still here?

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.240
What's this?

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.640
The Radiance of the Seven Gems?

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.480
It's the light of a highly virtuous person.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.000
That would explain

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.400
why no ghosts could enter the building.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.560
Master?

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.600
Are you staring at my chest?

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.640
A highly virtuous soul...

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.960
You're that dazzled by my chest?

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.360
No, I wasn't staring.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.120
I've brought Yok over to you.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.560
He said he was looking for his father.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.680
It's also getting late,

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.160
so I thought it'd be best
to bring him back to you.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.360
Yok?

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.920
Yes, Yok.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.400
What?

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.440
Where did he go?

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.440
He mustn't have gone far.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.560
I'm going to look for him.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.200
I don't have a child, though.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.800
So...

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.520
Is there anybody else here named Phloeng?

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.880
Yok said 'Phloeng'
was the name of his father.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.560
I'm the only Phloeng here.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.240
Then, does anybody else here
have a son named Yok?

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.000
He's about 5 years old

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.280
and is this tall.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.920
I'm a ghost radio host,

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.080
not a registrar.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.040
I was being polite with my question.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.360
So was I with my answer.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.880
With your answer?

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.920
You were messing with me.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.040
It's already late.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.080
Go home and rest

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.840
so that you grow up.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.080
Phloeng.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.080
How dare you call me short?

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.640
I didn't say that.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.320
You told me to grow up.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.040
I'm already 26.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.560
And this is as tall as I can get.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.080
Sure.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.640
"Sure?"

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.080
I'm definitely leaving.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.040
Just remember this.
A child ghost is following you.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.560
He looks exactly like you.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.520
And said he was looking for his father.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.640
That could be your past karma.
You'd better be careful.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.040
I'm a fortune teller.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.800
I can be scared, too, can't I?

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.560
Right.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.720
Thanks for worrying about me.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.040
Unfortunately, I don't believe in ghosts.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.720
You don't believe in ghosts,

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.080
but you're a ghost show host?

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.400
Yes, so what?

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.960
Wouldn't you need to
have a passion for ghosts?

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.800
It's nonsense.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.200
Ghosts aren't real.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.960
I just love listening to
the yapping nonsense from people like you.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.720
It's entertaining. Don't you think?

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.640
Yapping nonsense?

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.320
You can't see what I see in my world.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.520
What would you know?

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.480
Well...

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.080
Next time, show me what it looks like.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.720
Who the hell do you think you are?

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.040
Dare to take a guess?

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.040
What's wrong?

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.840
How long was I out for?

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.360
- 5 minutes.
- Only 5 minutes?

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.720
You've seriously been this restless?

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.640
Look at this. Is this a ghost show
or a comedy show?

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.080
Hey.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.960
I think Phloeng must've gotten
a girl pregnant.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.040
The boy named Yok you told us about...

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.800
What did he look like?

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.400
Did he look... complete?

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.440
He did.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.240
He looked just like a normal boy.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.280
No wounds, no distorted parts.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.920
Ghosts these days are weird.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.760
But the only thing is that...

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.760
The boy's father is insufferable.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.360
Maybe he needs your help.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.680
This again.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.240
A divine duty I didn't ask for.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.520
How about this?

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.640
Go and talk to his father.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.800
Tell him that he's got a son.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.320
Even though he's dead,

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.600
he wants his father to acknowledge
his past existence.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.200
I also believe that
the boy's mother had an abortion.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.000
That's why her son
has been going after his father, for justice.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.000
You're going wild with your theory,

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.440
while I simply met Yok's ghost.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.760
Come on, Win!

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.160
What would you know?

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.280
Phloengnathitorn is a massive player.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.040
See, despite his damn poor fashion taste,

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.520
he's goddamn handsome!

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.000
Imagine him dressing up properly.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.600
I bet girls would be all over him.

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.120
So what?

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.840
It'd be nothing strange
if he's gotten a girl pregnant, though,

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.880
especially since you said that
Yok looked just like him.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.320
Whatever it is,

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.040
I'm done doing business with the guy.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.080
Right, right.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.880
Then... I'm off to my divine duty.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.800
Wait. Where are you going?

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.080
The cat will stay in the bag.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.360
See you.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.680
- Bye-bye.
- You...

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.800
Right. See you.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.160
Catch you later.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.480
Oh, by the way,

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.440
we're out of stock.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.696
Could you fetch the items
from the Venerable Father?

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.880
I'll text him you're going.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Thank you.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.720
No problem.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.720
What the heck?

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.400
Hold on, Win.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.920
Should we come later?

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.600
This place looks scary.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.880
Then why are you following me here?

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.320
It gets too lonely!

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.960
I don't have anybody else to talk to.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.800
Just be careful, Toh.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.240
You're gonna get bullied by the local spirits.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.520
One of them could be
that speed demon relative of yours.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.080
You're right...

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.240
Damn it.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.280
I'm dead, and I'm still getting bullied?

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.320
Give me a break!

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.720
Hey, Tohmorn Rabbit?

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.240
What if you take off your mask

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.240
and scare the ghosts yourself?

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.640
No. It doesn't sound badass.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.320
Win, please take care of yourself.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.440
I can sense my rival gang in there.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.640
I'll... be seeing you!

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.920
Good to see you, Venerable Father.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.560
Oh, Win!

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.120
Who else did you bring here?

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.960
They're following you like an entourage.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.640
Huh?

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.160
Please don't tease me like that.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.920
Has the business been doing well?

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.640
It's been decent.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.240
If I had posted content on TikTok,

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.560
it would've been way better.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.520
But I'm not a great speaker.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.320
I'm lucky
I've got Namo and Tong with me.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.600
Tell me. How old are you this year?

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.920
I...

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.920
I just turned 26 last month.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.480
Do you know
it's your critical year of life transition?

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.880
But... I've looked it up on the Internet,

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.160
and it says that it happens at 25.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.760
That means I've made it, haven't I?

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.640
It's different for everyone.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.880
For you, it's this year, at the age of 26.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.800
You need to seek help
from a highly virtuous individual.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.800
- A highly virtuous individual?
- Yes.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.280
Is the year gonna be fatal for me, then?

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.920
This time, it certainly is.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.040
Father...

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.840
Please don't scare me like that.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:18.720
You told me that
you had recurring, bizarre dreams.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.680
Has that gone away?

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.440
No, it hasn't.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.200
What should I do?

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.280
I don't want to die.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.520
Should I get ordained again?

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.880
I'll do it for a year this time.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.240
Mm...

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.960
That might help.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.920
But not enough.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.200
This time, you're in grave danger.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.560
What am I supposed to do, Father?

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.360
Are you seriously going to let me die?

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.840
Keep yourself accompanied
by a highly virtuous individual.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.960
You may have already found one, I believe.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.480
You are watching Spooky Hellish Night,

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.880
a fiery night haunted
by horrors of the unknown.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.560
I'm Phloengnathitorn.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.440
We're joined by Jaab,
the person behind the story of this EP.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.456
To make this an even more special one,

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.800
this EP's also featuring
the White Knight Seer,

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.360
a clairvoyance expert.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.280
Hello, Master.
Hello, Jaab.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.320
Hello.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.920
Jaab,

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.376
I heard you've had an experience with a curse.
Is that correct?

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.040
- You enjoy ghost content?
- That's right.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.680
I was cursed,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.080
and I think that I still am.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.480
And...

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.560
Are you scared?

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:09.840
I'm not.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.080
If it's alright with you,

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.720
can we be FWBs?

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.240
How about we finish
what we've started first?

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.000
These are from the new batch.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.520
Feel free to take them.

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.120
Okay.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.040
Whoa.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.520
At this rate, even the guardian spirits
can't come in.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.880
Yeah, let's give this a try.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.200
Good luck coming in.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.040
Win!

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.400
No wonder it burns!

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.920
Who put those talismans on the door?

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.920
It won't be long, Toh.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.120
Gosh...

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.000
I'm almost done putting them on.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.520
Whoa!

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.720
Why aren't you wearing pants?

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.680
Put them on ASAP.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.120
Or I'll make it burn even more.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.080
Okay. Fine.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.120
I'm putting them on.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.320
Hold on...

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.520
Was that Toh's ghost?

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.800
Yeah.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.880
I offered him pants,
but he wouldn't put them on.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.760
Now he's walking around with it all out.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.840
He still refuses to stop flirting with you?

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.320
He's got over it.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.120
But, about my karmic creditor,

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.240
what should I do?

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.200
You don't even know who they are?

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.760
I have no idea.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.520
Have you tried tarot reading?

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.960
Perhaps the cards can show you
what they want.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.200
Tarot cards,

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.640
can you reveal to me

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.080
who is my karmic creditor,
that the Venerable Father told me about?

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.240
What the heck?

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.840
What happened?

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:33.840
It's confusing.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:39.520
Don't these cards say that
your karmic creditor is

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:44.080
a wealthy lady who died because of you?

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.800
That's not how you read the cards...

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.760
I have no clue.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.800
Are you ready?!

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.200
Are you ready?!

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.000
Win!

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.400
Win!

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.720
Here, Win!

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.000
Here!

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.960
Are you alright?

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.120
I'm fine.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.200
You suddenly tried to choke yourself.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.400
It was just like...

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.400
what happened at the studio.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.880
Is your karmic creditor this powerful?

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.720
Maybe.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.200
Or...

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.320
Am I actually going to die, Tong?

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.560
Don't say that.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.440
You'll make it.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.280
You told me you want to help those in need.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.080
You're right.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.520
Why don't you fight
your karmic creditor instead?

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.800
You're right...

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.760
Maybe you don't need to know who they are.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.000
How about you try to find out

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.720
why they want you to suffer this much?

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.080
Oh, fuck!

00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.960
Hey! Tong!

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.240
No, stop!

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.296
Is that a ghost at the door?

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:02.920
- No!
- Oh!

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.560
Don't tell me that...

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.720
Win! God, damn!

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.120
Shit just hit the fan!

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.760
Come on, Namo!

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.800
Were you trying to break in?

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.920
What's the problem?

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.480
What do you mean by that?

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.800
It's worse than just a problem!

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.000
Go to the Spooky Hellish Night
YouTube channel, now!

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.680
You're watching Spooky Hellish Night...

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:27.760
A million views!?

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.240
- A fiery night haunted by...
- It's got a million views?!

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:30.960
Yeah.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.880
- I'm Phloengnathitorn.
- Shit.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.560
- We're joined by Jaab...
- But I only rambled nonsense that day!

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.256
- To make this an even more special one,
- I even...

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.536
- today we're joined by...
- I even messed up the tarot reading!

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.720
That's the least of your concern right now.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.560
They've reached out
and want you to be on another EP.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.320
Plus, our agreement said
if this reached a million views,

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.479
they'd pay an extra 70,000 baht.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.360
And they just did that!

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.160
- Check your bank account.
- I was cursed,

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.960
and I think that I still am.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.480
- What's the story?
- Damn...

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.880
You're famous now!

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.176
You no longer have to
skip meals just to get by

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.240
and do fortune readings
for those pesky complainers.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.080
And can now enjoy
as much salmon as you like!

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.360
I want him to come back to me,

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.000
so I turned to the paranormal.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.560
This generation
is into such things, aren't they?

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.600
So where did you go for that?

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.800
Hold on...

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.440
If I need to record another EP...

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.120
Sorry?

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.880
This means I'll meet
Phloengnathitorn once again.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.520
It offers good luck wallpapers.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.040
Or is it him...

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.760
the foretold highly virtuous person?

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.120
I'm safe now!

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.840
- They let me choose
- What did you say?

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.776
- Aspects of my luck to enhance.
- You're safe from what?

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.520
- There's career, finance, and love.
- Just know that I'm safe.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.360
I chose love,

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.640
since I'd like him to come back to me.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.280
Sadhu.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.840
How will this turn out?

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.880
Another EP?
But I just had an argument with the host...

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.880
I can't concentrate at all.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000
What are you doing?

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.120
Hey!

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.520
You scared me, Toh.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.280
This is to protect myself
from the ghost in my dreams.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.880
Lately, I've had nightmares.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.400
Keep an eye on me
so I don't get disturbed, okay?

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.840
If that's the case,

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.840
then I shall keep you safe!

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.520
Come on...

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.240
You're being silly again.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.000
Just go already. I'm going to bed.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:33.600
Fine. I'll go.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.400
Good night, Win.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:37.680
Enough.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:38.760
Go, go!

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.280
See you.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.960
Am I already in my dream?

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.240
So this is how you want to do it?

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.320
You want a piece of me?!

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:48.960
What?!

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.520
Phloeng?

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.160
Having nightmares again?

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.480
Win...

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.920
You're safe now, Win.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.000
Happy one-month-belated birthday,
my dear brother!

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.720
She sent you a package, too.

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.320
Win, my dearest brother,

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.760
your sister is still alive and kicking.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.480
I embedded myself deep
in a village in the northeast.

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.160
I used the word 'embed'

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.680
because there are various things
worthy of learning here.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:44.440
Deep in the valleys,
through the rapid streams,

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.200
I had to hop on a villager's tractor
to get to my destination.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.640
When I'm back, I'll tell you everything.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:53.440
Please enjoy your 26th year
as much as you can.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:54.880
Much love and kisses,

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.520
Waew Wongsawat.

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.080
This really feels powerful.

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:26.320
What are you doing?

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.360
Waew sent me this.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.320
Doesn't it ever occur to you that
she could be a witch?

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.560
A witch?

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.080
Think about it,

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.840
she's obsessed with mythical rocks,

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.160
and her room is engulfed in aromatic herbs.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.720
She's even got a black cat as a companion,

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.560
going places together.

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.200
They say witches keep black cats!

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.000
The cat's name is Batman, though.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:57.680
Whatever its name is,

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.840
I think she's definitely a witch.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.320
A witch?

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.360
A broke witch, then.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.040
She's been working nonstop,

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:07.200
supporting her brother to graduation.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.200
It's a good thing that
she's no longer a witch.

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.280
Your sense is such a wasted potential.

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.120
Hey.

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.800
Nokphaeng sent us the text.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.480
"Meet tomorrow at 10, like last time."

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.320
10 A.M. again?

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.040
And wait until the cameras roll
at 10 P.M. like last time?

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.640
I made a stipulation.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.920
They'll have to pay
1,000 baht per delayed hour.

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.400
This time, we're making millions, Wongsawat!

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.480
Whoa!

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.320
Are they cool with that?

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.360
If it's the White Knight Seer,

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.080
the rising Twitter star,

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.600
they'd even pay 5,000 baht an hour
to get their hands on you.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.440
Hey, boys.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.600
What are you doing here?

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.960
And what's with the upset faces?

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:31.520
I'm here for a shoot.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.560
The three of you?

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.360
Check in with the staff inside
for the cards, okay?

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.520
What did he mean by "three?"

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.400
Tong hasn't arrived.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.960
Or is it Toh?

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:53.640
Wait...

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.480
Or is it the karmic creditor
the Venerable Father mentioned?

00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.840
Namo, you fool!

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.000
I'm already scared to death of them!

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:05.960
Come on! You'll be fine.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.320
Countless people made it past
their bad luck year.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.600
You might be one of them!

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.040
Is that how you cheer someone up?

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.840
Are you really entering like that?

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:19.760
Halt!

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:20.960
Hey!

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.960
Who's he talking to?

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.760
I have no idea.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.920
Don't think your virtuous soul could ever help.

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.840
You won't end up dead,

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:43.080
but I'll go after everyone around you.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.000
Win.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.160
Don't be afraid, dude. You have me.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.400
Poverty is way scarier than ghosts.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.680
Let's go.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.200
Yeah, let's get inside already.

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.640
Come on! Go, go, go!

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.920
- Yeah, let's go.
- Are you ready for the shoot?

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.120
Here are your snacks.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.480
Thank you.

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.296
- Please enjoy.
- That's so generous of you.

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.760
It's okay, Master.

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.320
You, the White Knight Seer,

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.840
are quite the talk of the town.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.480
Please make yourself at home.

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.040
Feel free to tell me
whatever you want or need.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.160
I'll get it for you.

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.760
No need to worry about my workload.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.680
The bonus pay from this is worth dying for.

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.656
It's so much that
I can make a down payment on a car!

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.080
I absolutely love this.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.600
I've also got a very generous boss.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.880
If you get to meet him,

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.880
I'm sure you're gonna like him.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.680
Please enjoy.

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:42.720
Thank you.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.000
There you are, the renowned Seer.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.360
Hello, Tul.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.600
- Hello.
- Greetings.

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.480
I'm Tul Tulatorn.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.280
Right. I'm Win Wongsawat.

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.400
You're the White Knight Seer?

00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.680
You can call me that, too.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.760
You probably haven't met him before.

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.280
This is Tul, the owner of the company.

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.920
Oh, you're the owner?

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.680
Huh?!

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.000
He's the owner, as in...

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.920
The owner of the entire Siam Nithrarom?

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.120
That's right.

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.176
- Nice to meet you.
- It's good to see you.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.040
No need for such formalities.

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.400
Please make yourselves at home.

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.240
I just wanted to welcome you.

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:28.040
Also, I watched that EP
of Spooky Hellish Night.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.920
You were very natural.

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.120
I appreciate that.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.520
And you...

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.560
Are you Namo, the manager?

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:37.440
That's correct.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.880
It's nice to meet you.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.920
Please have my business card.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:43.560
Here you go.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.840
Oh, Job?

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.600
Did you tell the Master about the show?

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.320
What show?

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.280
Job.

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.440
Here's the deal.

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.400
We're planning on making
a fortune-telling show,

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.320
and we'd love to have you as its host.

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.560
Huh?

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.040
Me?

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.600
If it's not you,
then there's nobody else who could.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.960
Well...

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.800
I've never done anything like this.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:17.920
I'm not a great speaker.

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.760
I've only done behind-the-scenes stuff.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.760
I'm afraid that...

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.880
Don't worry, Master.

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.440
Here at Siam Nithrarom,
we've got experts in everything

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:29.760
from creative and marketing

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.080
to video editing.

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.120
If you need any assistance,

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.400
please tell us.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.480
We're ready to support you 24/7.

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.160
You don't have to make a decision right now,

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.760
but kindly consider the offer.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.320
Right.

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.760
I'll think about it.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.160
As for the payment,

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.280
it will be worth your while.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.520
Right.

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:07.680
How's the contract?

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.360
Let me read all of the details first.

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:17.320
For today's EP, Nokphaeng wants it to be
as natural as it can be.

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:23.640
You could've at least
told me the topic of this EP,

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.520
or given my team some hints.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.240
Oh, Master.

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.000
I have no clue about that either.

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.040
I'm just the project coordinator.

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.096
Well, if there's anything you'd like to know,

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:35.760
you may want to ask Phloeng himself.

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:36.800
He's in that room.

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.216
That might not be a good idea.

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:41.240
It will be.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.440
He told me not to let anyone in

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.040
but the White Knight Seer.

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.040
Huh? Why is that?

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:50.520
I'm not sure about that, but...

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.800
I have to go now.

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.320
I've got work to do.

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:57.360
Right.

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:16.040
(Tong: On my way! I got lost again)

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.720
(Win: Hurry up, Namo abandoned me...)

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:32.120
Yok?

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.000
What brings you here?

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.240
I miss my dad.

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.800
So Phloeng must've gotten a woman pregnant

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.440
and made her get an abortion.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.200
You'd like to see your father?

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.840
If you get to meet him,

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.720
you'd finally cross over, right?

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:54.400
Cross over what?

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.080
Oh, you innocent soul.

00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.520
I feel so sorry for you.

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.640
(Phloengnathitorn: Spooky Hellish Night)

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:31.840
Phloeng?

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:35.960
Phloeng.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.120
If you don't mind, I'm going in.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.440
Phloeng.

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:56.320
Phloeng?

00:45:58.960 --> 00:45:59.960
Phloeng.

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.360
No, you're still alive.

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.640
Of course, if you act normally for once,

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.560
you'd become too perfect, wouldn't you?

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.440
I'd like to talk to the Master,

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.680
now that he's here.

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.120
You can talk here.

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.280
What are you looking at?

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.680
Nothing.

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.040
If you want to stare at my chest,

00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:59.280
just ask.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.120
Hey, look out!

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:03.840
Master, watch out!

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:13.600
Are you ready?

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:15.120
Are you ready?!
