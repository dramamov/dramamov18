WEBVTT

00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.770
Money's rolling in.
It's just rolling right in.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.850
It's pouring in from every direction,
relentlessly.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.980
Money, money, money.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.020
Money, money, money.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.390
Oh my goodness! Let me see.
Where did they hit you? How bad is it?

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.390
Oh my gosh!
Seriously, who were the guys who did this?

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.530
Gosh, did you call the police?

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.400
This is what you get for being so nasty.
You treated us like nobody at your party.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.470
- And this is what you get.
- Honestly.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.870
Are you sure you don't
need to go to the hospital?

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.300
Come here.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.180
For goodness' sake.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.110
About not being able to have you two
at the engagement party...

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.820
I'm truly sorry.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.250
I really insisted on you both coming,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.350
but I was told not to invite you.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.390
Who said that? Who said no?
Which son of a gun was it?

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.190
He said you two weren't
up to the hotel's standards...

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.830
- and would lower the tone.
- So I'm asking, who was it?

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.330
- Chairman Min Doo Sik.
- What?

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.000
That guy? Him?

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.640
He's one to talk about class
with a name like Doo Sik or whatever.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.980
All his kids have different mothers.
He gets married at the drop of a hat,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.710
and he has the nerve to say I'm low-class?

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.580
Is he richer than me? Better looking?
Is his name any better than mine?

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.990
That son of a...

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.620
Please calm down.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.160
That's just how he is.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.230
Yes, you're right.
That's the kind of bastard he is.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.300
That's why he treats people's lives
like they're nothing,

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.930
steals new tech others worked hard on,
and even swallows their companies whole.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.540
What are you talking about?

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.970
- Surely the chairman wouldn't do that.
- You didn't know?

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.740
That man, Min Doo Sik.
He's done so many inhuman, beastly things.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.050
30 Years ago,
Han Kyung Soo of Doeun Industries...

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.480
That whole suspicious incident accident
and death.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.990
The rest of the world may not know,
but I, Oh Pan Sool, know what happened!

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.020
CEO Han Kyung Soo of Doeun Industries?

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.530
It's getting really late,
so I should probably get going.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.470
Is it okay if I stop by often?

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.070
What? More often?

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.440
It's just that you remind me
of my late father.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.510
That's why I want to see you often.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.550
All of a sudden? Just like that?

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.580
Is this really you, Sun Jae?

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.550
You're not Sun Jae, are you?

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:25.980
You must be Soon Jae.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.350
Or maybe Sin Jae?

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.790
And another thing,
you treated your own father like an enemy.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.860
Honestly!

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.530
Of course.
You can come every day if you want.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.460
But tomorrow, we'll be at our shop
all day, so no one will be home.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.500
Some other time, then.
When you're both here.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.030
You're welcome anytime.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.070
If the gate's locked,
just let yourself in.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.770
I'll text you the code.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.570
I'll definitely come by again soon.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.680
And about the guy in that room,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.910
could you please not tell him I was here?

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.310
We don't get along very well
at the company.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.820
- Why? He seems like a nice young man.
- The online team and the Legal Team...

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.950
clashed over a contract.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.790
Okay then.
He asked me to keep it secret anyway.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.460
My lips are sealed.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.200
Darn it, where the heck
did he hide the ledger?

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:50.840
Gosh, seriously.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.140
What's this?

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.550
Is this Moon Tae Kyung?

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.650
If I can't find the ledger,
I'll have to take this instead.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.200
Why are you empty-handed?
I told you to bring the ledger.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.800
I'm not handing it over.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.740
That's the last card I have to play.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.310
So I can't just give it away.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.010
So you really want to take me on,
is that it?

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.610
I told you, I have someone else
to manage it for me now.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.780
You're completely useless to me now.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.320
You should be careful who you trust.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.190
You're being a fool.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:42.690
What was that?

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.720
You owe Moon Tae Kyung your life,
so you trust him more than your own son.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.130
Considering you're thinking of even
entrusting him with the ledger.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.530
But, Chairman.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.030
Do you even know
who Moon Tae Kyung really is?

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.200
- What do you mean, "who is he?"
- Moon Tae Kyung is...

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.550
the son of CEO Han Kyung Soo,
Doeun Industries.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.050
Thirty years ago,

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.520
you had him murdered
in a staged car accident...

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.760
and stole his company and new technology!
He's the son of that Han Kyung Soo!

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.060
Where are you getting
this ridiculous nonsense?

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.370
I found this in Moon Tae Kyung's room.
Do you still refuse to believe me?

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.740
Wait, this is CEO Han.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.180
- Then, is Moon Tae Kyung really...
- He's here to avenge his father.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.350
That's why he joined Mingang.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.650
Why has Moon Tae Kyung been saving you?

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.750
When you were nearly sent
to a nursing home,

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.320
when you were being held captive,

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.530
why would he risk his life to save you?
His own father's murderer.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.030
Do you still not see it?

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.000
Moon Tae Kyung is trying to put you
on trial.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.640
He wants to charge you for all your crimes
and ensure you get the maximum sentence.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.480
So you'll be in prison
for your entire life,

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.110
living a life worse than death.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.780
Now do you understand?

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.590
Hey, Lawyer Kim.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.530
What are you doing here?
I thought you were on vacation.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.530
You look terrible. What happened?

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.530
Hey, wait up!

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.400
How's Kyung Chae doing?
Did she get her memory back?

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.810
Come on, why are you here?
I thought you were on leave for a while.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.440
You even took a long leave.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.480
To see the chairman. Satisfied?

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.180
Gosh. That brat's so full of himself.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.120
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.760
Chairman, what brings you here?

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.160
Come to think of it,
he does look like Han Kyung Soo.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.700
Why are you staring at me like that?
Is there something you need?

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.370
You could have just called me
to your office.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.640
To avenge his own father,

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.410
he wormed his way in here, and he's been
plotting against me all along?

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.680
Chairman, are you feeling all right?

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.990
You...

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.760
You...

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.860
What's wrong, Chairman?

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.530
You think you can take me down?

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.970
- Chairman.
- Not a chance.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.900
Not a chance! Not a...

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.540
- Chairman!
- Not a...

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.410
Chairman!

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.510
Chairman, stay with me!

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.080
Try to stay conscious! Chairman!

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:04.760
Where have you been?

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.560
And what happened to your face?

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.590
It's nothing.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.100
But...

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.170
what do you think would happen
if the chairman were to collapse?

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.970
My father is tough as nails.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.440
You've seen it yourself.
He's still standing strong despite it all.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.940
Especially with someone now doting on him.
Why would he collapse?

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.380
But when faced with an unimaginable shock,

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.920
even the chairman wouldn't be immune.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.350
- What's that supposed to mean?
- An unbearable shock,

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.420
a truth you refuse to believe,
and the betrayal of someone you trusted.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.790
The human body just shuts down.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.430
He can fight it with all his might,

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:44.930
but it's only a question
of how long he'll last.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.530
In the end, he will inevitably break down.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.960
What the? Where'd he go?

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.100
Let's just chill here for a while.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.870
Aren't you supposed to be working?
Can you just leave the office like that?

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.870
I'm not the only one.
Director Moon is gone, too.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.640
- Where did he go?
- How should I know?

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:31.180
These days, I just want to quit
and walk away from it all.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.480
Gosh.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.680
What am I even working toward?
Father or Kyung Chae will be Chairman,

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:36.750
and Lucia will be CEO.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.150
Where does that leave me?
There's no room to move up.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.920
Kyung Chae's not a candidate for Chairman.
Not after what she did to Dad.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.720
You think he'd hand
the company over to her?

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.530
Besides, she was kicked out of
both the house and the company.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.730
You have a point.
One wrong move and she was...

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:53.530
on the verge of being disowned,
but now that she has amnesia,

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.470
Father is just waiting
to see what happens.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.470
Honestly, if she were in her right mind,
all chaos would've broken loose by now.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.340
But I wonder when Kyung Chae's memory
will come back.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.480
She's not going to be like this forever,
is she?

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.410
They say the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.050
Dad's dementia, her amnesia.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.020
Doesn't that seem a little fishy to you?

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.280
Fishy how?

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.450
The chairman will probably let this slide,
don't you think?

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.260
- Let what slide?
- The chairman's kidnapping.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.290
He'll just kick out the main culprit,
Kyung Chae,

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.060
and we won't get caught
in the fallout, right?

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.830
With Ms. Kyung Chae in her current state,
what bigger fallout could there be?

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.900
See, that's why people misunderstand you,
Manager Gong.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.870
Even I misunderstood
when I first joined this family.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.310
- Misunderstood what?
- That you were Kyung Chae's real mother.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:45.320
I thought there was a secret to her birth.
I mean, when it comes to Kyung Chae,

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:48.250
you bend over backwards to protect her.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.090
Acting just like her real mother
all the time.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.860
That's because I practically raised her
with my own two hands.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.830
Still, you're over the top.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:02.130
The way you dote on Kyung Chae
is over the top,

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.200
and the way she treats Se Ri
is over the top too.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.940
Someone died because of me.

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.040
Who died?

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.310
So you regret it?

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.750
Did you feel any remorse?

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.220
Do you even think you did anything wrong?

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.830
What are you doing here like this?

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:33.000
Manager Gong.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.830
- I think I'm a terrible person.
- What are you talking...

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.540
I admit I was rebellious
and acted out for a while.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:41.840
Back then, I thought it was cool.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.310
But I thought I'd finally grown up.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.250
When my stepmom arrived, I felt accepted,
and I started to feel more stable.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.150
And?

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:56.290
It just feels wrong to keep a secret
from someone I care about so much.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.820
What secret?

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.830
That incident from four years ago.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.490
The kid who died because of me back then.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.870
So you're going to tell Madam Jung
about that right now?

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.940
I want to tell her everything so there are
no more secrets between me and her.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.940
She doesn't hide anything from me.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.910
Everything else is normal,
and he's mostly breathing on his own now,

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.610
but he's just not regaining consciousness.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.220
There's no other medical explanation.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:25.650
By any chance,

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.620
did he recently experience a major shock?

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.320
No, not that I'm aware of.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:35.560
Did something happen?

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.030
No.
He suddenly appeared at the team's office,

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.160
and then he collapsed.

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.500
I have no idea what could've happened.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.570
It's not possible
he'll never wake up, right?

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.540
I don't think that's likely.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.540
In any case, we'll have to wait and see.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.980
I'll keep a close eye on
the chairman's condition,

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:55.950
so please try not to worry too much.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.260
What is this I'm hearing?
Min Doo Sik is unconscious?

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.620
That's what happened.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.030
How can something like that
happen overnight?

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.430
His personal physician said
he must have suffered a major shock.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.700
Being kidnapped by his own child,
I guess that would do it.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:19.540
It'd be stranger if he wasn't shocked
by his own child's depraved act.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.470
That incident was more of a wake-up call
for him than a shock.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.210
He told me so himself.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:28.480
He said he was glad he finally got to see
his children's true colors.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:33.420
So he kicked out his eldest daughter
and changed his will, I suppose.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.390
Then what in the world happened?

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.990
He was perfectly fine just yesterday.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.790
I had dinner with him last night.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:45.600
So this must have happened
sometime in the past 12 hours.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.400
Which means someone must have dropped...

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:52.170
a bombshell on Chairman Min.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.850
I wasn't slacking off.
I had to discuss business with a partner.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.720
Yes, I understand. Look, I get it.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:15.260
Vice Director, did you go
to the chairman's office this morning?

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:16.860
The chairman's office?

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.230
No. Why do you ask?

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:22.600
It's nothing. Never mind.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.810
But I think Lawyer Kim stopped by
the chairman's office.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.510
Lawyer Kim Sun Jae?

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.480
But he's not with the company anymore.

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.350
I know, right?
He was here for some reason.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.520
I ran into him in the lobby earlier.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.350
He said he'd just left
the chairman's office.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:50.790
It was Kim Sun Jae.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.260
Kim Sun Jae stopped by
the chairman's office this morning.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.230
Are you serious?

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.240
Come to think of it, Chairman Min Doo Sik
called Kim Sun Jae yesterday...

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.000
and told him to bring the secret ledger.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.110
So he must have come to return it and...

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.740
Wait a second.
But that doesn't make sense.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.180
His survival depends on
holding on to that ledger.

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:09.950
Why would he hand it over so willingly?

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.850
Then why else would he have gone
to the chairman's office?

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.320
Based on what you're saying, Tae Kyung,
shouldn't he be avoiding him?

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.260
It makes no sense for him
to walk in there willingly.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.160
I think I need to go see him myself.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.000
You called me here, so spit it out.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.470
Why did you go to the chairman's office?

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.040
Come on, you saw me at the restaurant
yesterday. Why are you asking?

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:37.010
I was following the chairman's orders.

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:40.110
I went to return the ledger
I've been managing. What about it?

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:44.520
So, did you return the entire ledger?

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.250
I couldn't do that.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:48.220
How could I when it was stolen?

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.390
You have one of them, don't you?
Why are you playing dumb?

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.630
So you only handed over part of it?

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:01.030
If the chairman finds out it's incomplete,
he's not the type to just let it slide.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:03.630
What are you trying to say?

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:05.470
The ledger.

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:08.370
You still have it, don't you?

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.710
You must have given the chairman
something else instead.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.810
And what do you think I gave him instead?

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.800
The chairman won't be coming home tonight.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.830
Why?
Don't tell me he's gone missing again.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:39.140
Don't be ridiculous.
It's not like going missing is his hobby.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:41.570
He's at Hankuk Hospital right now.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.270
He collapsed. He's unconscious.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.840
What?

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.450
Unconscious? What happened?
Why so suddenly?

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.980
It couldn't have been Kyung Chae,
given her condition.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.780
Don't tell me...

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.790
Did you do something
to your father, Soo Jung?

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:58.960
Hey! What do you take me for?

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.530
Why did he collapse?

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:04.930
He went into shock.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:10.500
Doctor Kim says he's breathing on his own
more than half the time, and he's stable,

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.740
so the situation isn't hopeless.

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:17.410
What kind of shock would it take
to knock someone unconscious like that?

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.880
I know, right?

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.640
Do you think he'll ever wake up?

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:24.250
You don't think he's just going to
kick the bucket like this, do you?

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.490
When you say it isn't hopeless,
does that mean he could wake up soon?

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:30.550
Right now, it's fifty-fifty.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.930
Anyway, now you all know the situation.
Watch what you say at the company...

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:35.990
and be on your best behavior.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:51.580
Okay.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.950
Dad's going to be okay, right?

00:17:58.450 --> 00:17:59.750
You know how strong he is.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.150
It's his body's way of protecting itself,
so he temporarily lost consciousness.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.790
That's how his body is able to cope.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.690
What could have happened
to cause such a reaction?

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.100
It depends on the person,
but when some experience a severe shock,

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.300
some can even develop aphasia
or start sleepwalking.

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:18.600
Aphasia is when you can't talk, right?

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.070
And sleepwalking is
when you wander off in your sleep.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.310
Exactly.

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.910
How severe does the shock have to be
for a healthy person to end up like that?

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:32.280
There was this woman I knew.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.380
It happened to her
after her daughter died.

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:36.290
Her daughter died?

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.290
How?

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.320
She was an innocent victim,

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:42.560
but she was framed
as the perpetrator instead.

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.560
She should've just said it was unfair.
Why not just reveal the truth?

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.170
As if the world ever listens
to the powerless.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.040
So...

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:56.140
what happened to the woman
after her daughter died?

00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:59.310
You're curious?

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:05.220
You'll find out everything soon enough.

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:06.820
Just be patient.

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.320
About Father,
he seemed fine when I saw him at work.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.460
But if he's just laid up like that,
what's going to happen to the company?

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.330
Now that you mention it,
the company is in trouble.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.160
The chairman's seat will be empty.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.300
Will Kyung Chae take over again?

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.870
She's the acting chairman, after all.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.170
But Father fired her.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.810
That was when he was perfectly fine.
Things are different now.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.110
Yes.

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.650
What are you going to do?
Shouldn't you go see Father?

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.520
I was already planning to.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:46.890
I can't just sit back and take
that woman's word for it.

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:49.130
Exactly! We're his children.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.400
So who does she think she is,
bossing us around over every little thing?

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:55.770
That's right.
We should go to the hospital and see him,

00:19:55.870 --> 00:20:00.170
and look after him.
That way, we score points when he wakes.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.310
Exactly!

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:02.940
I'm telling you, she'll tell Father...

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.980
she alone cared for him,
to take the credit.

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.770
Where'd it go?

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.280
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:44.210
Rock, paper, scissors.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:45.920
Rock, paper, scissors.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.750
How come you get to eat
whether you win or lose?

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:49.890
I paid for it.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:53.420
For crying out loud.
Fine, eat it all! Go on!

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.530
Excuse me, ma'am?
Did you happen to come into my room?

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.930
No. Why would I go into your room?

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.170
I just thought you might have
gone in to clean up.

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:07.470
And you didn't go in either, did you, sir?

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:10.210
No.
Why? Is something missing from your room?

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.280
Yes, a photo.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:13.780
What kind of photo?

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.050
A family photo of me with my parents.

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.580
Take a good look around.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.350
It's not like it's cash or a gold bar.
Who would steal a family photo?

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:24.090
You probably put it somewhere else
and forgot.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.890
You're probably right.
I must have misplaced it.

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.390
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:35.070
Why haven't we heard from Sun Jae?
Was he just all talk?

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.870
He'll come by.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.040
When has he ever broken a promise?
I even gave him the gate code. He'll come.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.440
Excuse me, when you say Sun Jae...

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.310
Are you talking about lawyer Kim Sun Jae?

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.450
Yes, he's my nephew.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.790
He stopped by briefly
the night before last.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:59.090
That's right.
You must know our Sun Jae too.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.630
Of course. I know him.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.200
For him to come all the way here
on purpose...

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:14.300
means he must know that I'm living here.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:16.770
Then, could it be...

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.720
No.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.820
If he was looking for this
and couldn't find it,

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.690
he should've left empty-handed.

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:34.120
So why would he take the
family photo instead?

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:37.490
Could it be...

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.230
that he showed it to Chairman Min Doo Sik?

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:44.740
That means he knows who my father is,

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:47.800
and he also knows about the bad karma
between my father and Chairman Min.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.210
But how on earth could he have known that?

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:54.110
Unless...

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:57.780
Wait, so then,

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:00.380
he knows who you really are?

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:02.490
I think so.

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:05.890
Not just Kim Sun Jae,
but Chairman Min Doo Sik too.

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:09.530
So that's why he was in shock.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:15.170
Imagine his shock at your parents' photo.
He must have realized what he'd done.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.270
The memory of his sins
must have come flooding back.

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:19.300
If Chairman Min Doo Sik
regains consciousness,

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.610
the first thing he'll do is
try to get rid of me.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:25.480
Wait, so are we supposed to
hope he never wakes up?

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:30.550
If that happens, Min Doo Sik's past sins
will be buried forever.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:33.550
If I want to bring him to justice
and make him pay for his crimes,

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.420
I have no choice but to hope he wakes up.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.290
There's no easy answer.

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:44.630
Really?

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.300
When did that happen?

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:49.630
Okay, got it.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.200
What is it?

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.070
The chairman is in the hospital,
unconscious.

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:02.850
Wait, where are you going?

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:04.310
I have to go home.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:07.120
No, wait, maybe I should
stop by the office first.

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:10.420
Call Manager Gong and tell her
to bring me my clothes.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.490
(Mingang Distribution)

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.270
What do we do now?

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:25.840
What if Father never wakes up?

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:27.900
I know.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:33.110
What?

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:34.910
Kyung Chae? What are you doing here?

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:36.680
Come on, sit down.

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:40.750
Hey, did you get your memory back?
Who am I? How many fingers?

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:44.890
Did you not hear me? I said to sit down.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.930
About Father...

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.490
I heard he's at Hankuk Hospital,
unconscious.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.400
So why are you all just sitting around?

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.470
- You think we should go now?
- Of course we should.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.270
Are we just going to take her word for it
and do nothing?

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:02.070
Of course not! We need to see
for ourselves and prepare...

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:04.240
But, Kyung Chae.

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:06.580
What happened with your amnesia?

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:08.980
Can't you tell just by looking at her?

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.510
Amnesia? Please.

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:12.950
Don't tell me you pulled
the same amnesia act as Father.

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:17.090
- Wait, it was all an act?
- That's not what's important right now.

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.890
Right now, whether we like it or not,
we have to stick together.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:24.060
There's no other way.
We can only stop her with our shares.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
(Hankuk Hospital)

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.630
No visitors? Are you serious?

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.200
I'm afraid so.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.940
His legal guardian insisted on it.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.740
That was that woman...

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:40.310
I mean, our stepmother did this.
It's not hospital policy.

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:43.450
You'd think the doctor would have
the discretion to let us in.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.480
If his legal guardian has blocked visits,
my hands are tied.

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:50.450
So you're saying we came all this way just
to be turned away without seeing him?

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:53.820
Come on, Doctor. That's a little harsh.
We'll just be a minute.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.330
We need to see his condition
for ourselves.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:59.460
We won't take long.
Please just let us in for a second.

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:02.270
- I'm afraid not. Please leave.
- Look here!

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:05.040
Go and get permission from Madam Jung.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.310
(Mingang Distribution)

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:16.350
This is ridiculous. We all went there
just to get shut down? We look like fools.

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:19.050
So now we can't see Dad
without that woman's permission?

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.320
I swear, I've seen it all now.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.830
Why isn't she in the CEO's office?
Where could she be?

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.030
But she doesn't have any meetings today.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.140
What?

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.780
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be in the CEO's office?

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:48.880
And why are you in the chairman's chair?

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:53.380
I'm acting chairman until he wakes up.
So this is where I belong.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:56.450
What are you talking about?
Kyung Chae is the acting chairman.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.320
Sure, Father got mad
and threw her out, but...

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.690
Still, this is an emergency,
so we should go by the will.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:06.060
That was the old will.
The chairman amended it a few days ago.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.730
Amended the will?

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:13.570
How's your memory?

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.270
- Has it all come back?
- In the new will, instead of my sister,

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.780
you're the acting chairman?
Is that what you're saying right now?

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:22.780
That's what the chairman's will says.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:24.580
Then what happens to the CEO position?

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:27.920
I'm only one person.
The CEO position is vacant for now,

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:29.490
but this position is
more urgent right now.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:30.890
I don't believe this.

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:35.060
No one knew Dad amended his will,
and you expect us to believe you?

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:39.460
- I'm with her. We're to believe you?
- So you don't believe me?

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:43.630
But I think Kyung Chae already knows,
don't you?

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:48.940
About who the new acting chairman is
now that the will has been amended.

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:52.340
Since Lawyer Park is friends
with Lawyer Kim Sun Jae,

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:54.380
I'm sure you must have heard something.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:59.450
If you know something, spit it out!
Tell us what's going on.

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:00.680
Kyung Chae!

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.220
She's right.

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:05.960
Father amended his will a few days ago.

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.430
As for the acting chairman,

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:11.930
he didn't choose me.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.100
He chose Jung Lucia.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.320
