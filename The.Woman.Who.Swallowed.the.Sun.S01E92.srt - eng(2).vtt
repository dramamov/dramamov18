00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.470
(Mingang Distribution)

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.480
(Episode 92)

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.350
How convenient. You're both here.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.210
I won't beat around the bush.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.780
You need to step down from your position.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.220
And Director Moon Tae Kyung,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.090
you're fired as well.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.460
What is the meaning of this?

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.700
Wait, regardless of the reason,
you can't just fire us like this.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.660
After causing that affair scandal?
You have no shame.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.770
When you're told to get out, you get out!

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.900
Wait, Director Jeong.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.810
You're crossing a line.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.940
Did you even bother to check the facts?

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.680
We have photos of you at a motel.
What more proof do you need?

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.320
Don't tell me you're denying it
because we didn't catch you in the act.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.090
You can't keep your position
after pulling something like this.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.620
This makes us look bad
for approving you as CEO.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.860
This scandal drags more than
just your name through the mud.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.330
Did Min Kyung Chae,
the acting chairman, put you up to this?

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.630
Told you to storm my office and remove me?

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.770
We're not Min Kyung Chae's puppets.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.670
We're acting on our own. Satisfied?

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.040
- The directors will take care of it.
- They'd better.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.750
They only sided with her back then because
they feared Father learning their secrets,

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.380
but the situation's different now.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.450
Let them get rid of those two.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.350
We can just wait and see what happens.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:20.890
We should.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.520
If you're not doing this
on someone's orders,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.560
that's even worse.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.130
At least I could've felt sorry for you
if you were.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.260
Look here. Your affair photos
are all over the company,

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.700
so where do you get off being so defiant?

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.170
Address her with respect.
Who are you to speak to the CEO like that?

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.840
This is just embarrassing.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.900
Are you seriously defending her?

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.170
It's a relief the chairman is away.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.180
He'd be devastated if he saw this mess.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.020
I'm glad you mentioned him.
We went there because of the chairman.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.390
Don't be ridiculous!

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.960
Why would you go to a motel
because of the chairman?

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.230
It's clear you'll only hear what you want
and insist you're right.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.430
It's clear you'll get your way,
so I'll save my breath.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.900
But the truth will come out soon enough.
Now, all of you, please leave.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.200
I will handle this myself.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.910
Who do you think you are, a mob boss?

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.350
Sending your minions
to do your dirty work?

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.010
Enjoying playing the boss?

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.350
This all could've been avoided
if you'd just stepped down.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.920
Why make things so difficult for everyone?

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.220
You're just the acting chairman,
not the official one.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.420
I, on the other hand, was approved
by the board of directors.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.090
So you refuse to step down?

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.330
I have no reason to.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.200
Then you leave me no choice.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.270
I'll call for an official board meeting
and process your dismissal there.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.140
And what if I veto the call
for a board meeting?

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.340
As the convener, I refuse.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.980
Go ahead and try without my permission.
And if you want to kick me out,

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.720
shouldn't you become
the official chairman first,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.220
instead of just the acting one?

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.560
The acting chair telling me to step down?
How absurd.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.370
I used my veto power to block her
from calling a board meeting.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.670
Does that mean we're in the clear now?

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.480
For Min Kyung Chae to have me dismissed,
she must be the official chairman first.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.950
For her to be inaugurated as chairman,
she needs the board's approval.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.120
I'm sure the board's approval is a given.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.820
It'll be approved
the moment a meeting is convened.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.260
Look at the chaos they're causing already.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.960
That's why I used my veto power to stop
the board meeting from being held at all.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.260
Veto power? That's what she said?

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.560
What, did she go
to law school or something?

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.200
She acted like she knew her stuff.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.240
What's wrong?

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.840
Never mind. It's nothing.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.210
Don't worry.
Go ahead and call the board meeting.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.710
Once you've been officially approved
by the board and take the chairman's seat,

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.080
then you can move to have her dismissed.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.850
But I told you,
she said she'll veto the meeting.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.350
There's absolutely no way
she can use that veto power.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:10.920
Just trust me,

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.520
and convene the board meeting
as soon as possible.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.600
Honestly,
I never liked her from the start.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.440
Come on. It's not some Cinderella story.
She started as a regular employee,

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.310
and then became the chairman's wife?
Does that even make sense?

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.710
Tell me about it.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.010
That's more like a rocket ship to the top.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.780
Look at the situation now. My husband,
the chairman's son, is being sidelined.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.350
And yet, that woman is the CEO,
throwing her weight around.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.660
By the way, do you think she's having
an affair with Director Moon Tae Kyung?

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.690
Why else would there be pictures?

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.930
At a motel in broad daylight, no less.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.670
What's wrong? Are you upset
that I'm dissing your precious stepmother?

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.380
You shouldn't be acting like this either,
you know.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.150
I don't care how much
she has you under her spell.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.380
You're supposed to be
on your family's side.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.780
When are you going to stop defending her?

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.050
For your information, I'm not
on my stepmother's side this time.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.990
My gosh! What's gotten into you?

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.370
Are you going to keep avoiding me?

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.270
Right now, I don't really want to.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.880
So that's why
you weren't answering my calls.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.750
I suppose I haven't been
a very good mother to you.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.050
I never thought you'd jump
to conclusions so easily.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.990
Sweetheart, I was there with Director Moon
for something else.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.520
To save your father.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.330
To save Dad?

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.130
(Chairman Min Doo Sik: Lucia, it's me.
I need you to come save me.)

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.150
Fancy seeing you here after work.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.180
This is practically my home now, isn't it?

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.690
Where's Ms. Kyung Chae?

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.590
She'll be right in. She stepped out
into the garden to take a call.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.830
You seem to know a thing or two
about the law, Mother-in-law.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.300
I hear you gave Kyung Chae
a little legal lesson.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.670
What, did you major in law or something?

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.170
I used to have a boyfriend
who was studying for the bar exam,

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.940
and I just picked up
a few things from him.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.510
I don't know him, but he sounds brilliant.
This boyfriend of yours.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.180
I bet he passed the bar
with flying colors...

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.620
and is living a very successful life now,
don't you think?

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.120
But it seems you only know half the story.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.890
Didn't your boyfriend teach you that part?

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.160
Allow me to teach you instead.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.960
Commercial Act, Article 390, Paragraph 2.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.540
If the convener refuses to call a meeting
of the Board of Directors,

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.970
with a majority vote of the directors,

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.110
they can convene
a board meeting themselves.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.380
You didn't know that, did you?

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.680
Mother!

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.950
I can expect
the special son-in-law dinner, right?

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.790
I'm looking forward to
your famous home cooking!

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.530
She's got some nerve.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.710
I expected the directors to turn on us,
but this is all happening too fast.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.940
How long has Min Kyung Chae
even been the acting chairman?

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.540
They're just jumping ship.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.710
If they had any decency, they'd be worried
about the chairman who vanished.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.450
They should be trying to find him.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.250
They're all scrambling
to save their skins.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.220
It's a complete dog-eat-dog world.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.260
It's a feeding frenzy, with everyone
trying to tear each other down.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.960
By the way, did you settle up
with Oh Pan Sool for his earnings?

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.870
Yes. He was grinning from ear to ear.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.440
His head is probably about
to explode by now.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.670
The math is simple,
and his greed is endless.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.010
He can't resist
selling his Mingang shares...

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.780
to get his hands on a big pile of cash.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.550
Gosh, she has this strange ability
to just mesmerize people.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.320
Her face, her figure, her feminine wiles,

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.450
even the way she speaks.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.620
She acts like one of the big shots,
but she's not vulgar in the slightest.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.260
Her investment skills?
Don't get me started.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.630
Ten out of ten. Absolutely perfect.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.800
Should I just trust her and go all in?

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.400
What's the use of hoarding money?
You can't take it with you when you go.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.370
The Grim Reaper
will just take it all anyway.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.370
Right. If Mal Sook finds out,
she'll never let up.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.210
So I have to do it on the sly.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:06.050
What are you in such a hurry to hide?

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.550
Hiding what? There's nothing here.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.330
I smell money.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.760
First your eyesight starts to go,
and now your sense of smell is going too?

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.630
Gosh, that's just my stinky feet. Here.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.970
No, it's not.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.870
This smells like cash
rolled up in a newspaper.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:29.310
I can smell the ten-dollar bills.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.410
And that's the 50-dollar bills.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.250
My darling wife, my feet actually smell...

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.250
- like money. Here, smell!
- I don't think so.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.390
- Scoot over.
- What for?

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.620
No way. I'm not moving. I can't.
I like it right here.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.290
I'm staying right here until bedtime.

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:50.060
Oh Pan Sool, you're acting suspicious.
I said, move aside right now.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.200
Not even if I die.
I'll die right here in this very spot.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.170
You're not messing
with the stock market again, are you?

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.070
You'd have to be inhuman to forget that...

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:58.100
you lost our house on Yeonpyeong Island.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.670
- I told you, it's not that.
- Just get up already!

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.710
I won't!

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:04.780
Oh my!

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.850
What are you doing again?
Are you trying to give Ja Kyung a sibling?

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.850
- Fine, let's do it! Let's go for it!
- No, stop!

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.520
(Mingang Distribution)

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.220
Hey, Soo Jung!
I've been doing some thinking.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:21.330
I don't think Father is just missing.
I have a feeling a crime is involved.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:24.260
Ji Seop, don't you think
you're going a little overboard?

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.170
But still...
Despite his history, this feels different.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.440
So you think someone kidnapped him?
Who in the world would do that?

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.370
Obviously, it'd be whoever benefits
the most from Father being gone.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:37.640
Then it's Kyung Chae.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.110
She's the acting chairman
while Dad's away.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:45.680
Or it could be Lucia. She has a lover,
so Father is just a thorn in her side.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.890
It's either one of them, or both.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.490
Don't you know those two
hate each other's guts?

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.260
If I have to pick one,

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.690
- I say Kyung Chae.
- Then I say Lucia.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:59.460
Seriously?
How can we find him if we can't agree?

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:02.630
We can figure that out later.
Let's just focus on finding Father first.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.470
Once we find Father,
we'll solve it all in one go. Right?

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:16.880
What is it? What's the favor?

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:18.550
You've got a lot of sources, right?

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:20.020
I need to borrow them.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.220
What for?

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.160
I'm going to look for Father.
It's been ages since that old geezer left.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.960
And you think you're going to find him?

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.260
That's why I'm asking
to borrow your sources.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.230
We can't just rely on Kyung Chae.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.900
Just let her handle it. Stay out of it.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.270
I'm busy, so don't drag me out here
for this kind of thing again.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.070
Gosh, to hear you talk, anyone would think
you run the company single-handedly.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.540
Because I am doing it all myself.

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:42.670
I have to call an emergency board meeting,
and I have a mountain of work to do.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.580
Hey, Sun Jae!
Come on, hear me out. Just lend me a few.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.150
What are friends for? Please.
Seriously, just hear me out.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.920
- Give it a rest!
- Sun Jae, wait!

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.990
What were you and Lawyer Kim
talking about?

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.630
Gosh, you're nosy.
I told him I'll find Father. So what?

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.560
And what did he say to that?

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.300
He told me not to bother.
Said that Kyung Chae has it under control.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.470
He said he's busy calling a board meeting.
Are we done here? Darn it.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.950
They're calling a board meeting soon.
And at the meeting, Min Kyung Chae...

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.650
will be officially appointed as chairman.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.820
Once the board of directors convenes,
it's just a formality.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.690
I didn't realize my veto power
could be rendered this useless.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.590
The law is the law.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.330
Then, before the board of directors
is convened,

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.700
we have to find Chairman Min Doo Sik,
no matter what it takes.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.700
Who's looking for Father?

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.570
It's just Ji Seop. You know how he is.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.040
He's an expert at spinning his wheels.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.940
You mentioned moving Father last time.
What's the status on that?

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:55.080
We can't risk Ji Seop snooping around
and accidentally finding Father.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.650
We're already planning to move him
to the outskirts of Gyeonggi Province.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.580
Shinyul Hospital...

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.120
has a busy intersection out front.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.050
It's too easy for someone
to spot him there.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.960
Besides, who would know about
the side road...

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.560
from the intersection to the highway?

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:09.530
Anyway, Lawyer Kim, you take care of it.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.330
The vice director said
he'd find Chairman Min,

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:13.700
and he was told not to.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.100
Is he worried the vice director
might actually find the chairman?

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.270
Those two want to make sure no one
can find Chairman Min.

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:24.480
Since he escaped once before,
they must be looking for a new place.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.110
And since the vice director said
he's taking action now, they'll hurry.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:31.920
I think they'll move him
in the next day or so.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.220
Then they'll definitely talk about it
in the chairman's office.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:38.320
The chairman's office is the perfect place
for those two to plot.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:39.890
Perfect.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.330
If we check the bug in the vase,
we'll know for sure.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.130
Let's go check now.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.930
Then call for a board meeting tomorrow,

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:50.500
and move Father.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:51.670
Will do.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.810
Lawyer Kim, just make sure
there are no complications.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.510
What kind of complications?

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.280
Unless the chairman himself shows up
and crashes the board meeting.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.250
- Is that even possible?
- Exactly my point.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:05.050
The chairmanship is a sure thing now,

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:06.480
so don't worry.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.330
What is it? Ever hear of knocking?

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.400
It's nothing.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.030
Let's go.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.370
What was that about?

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.040
Thank goodness. The vase was still there.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.740
Let's come in early tomorrow morning...

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.450
and retrieve the bug.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.620
What? What's this?

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.050
Ta-da!

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:46.060
Oh, my, what is all this?

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:51.960
I felt bad for being mean the other day,
so I ordered this with my allowance.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.530
Go on, try some. Hurry.

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:56.130
Should I?

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.370
This looks so good.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.180
- You have some too, Se Ri.
- Okay.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.360
It's good, right?

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:21.030
This is all the rage with kids these days.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:32.340
It's sweet and a little spicy.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.540
It's so good.

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:39.010
You're right.
It's got this addictive spicy kick,

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.280
so all my stress just melted away.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:44.650
Right?
I told you, you can't stop eating it.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:50.950
But...

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.620
I thought you didn't believe me.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:55.860
That you didn't want to understand?

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.660
Honestly, I was disappointed
when I first saw the picture,

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:04.300
but I know you.
You'd never do something like that.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.540
I don't know who sent it, but that person
is the one who's in the wrong.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.810
Thank you, sweetheart.
For believing in me.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.050
Eat up! This is delicious.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.020
Look at you two enjoying your chicken.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.960
You seem to be in a good mood,
given the situation.

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:32.700
Is there any reason not to be?
I'm having a cozy snack with my daughter.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.700
Eat up. Don't mind her.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:38.900
Okay.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.540
Fine.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.510
Enjoy it while you still can.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:55.790
Go ahead, enjoy it all you want.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.460
Once the board approves
my chairmanship tomorrow,

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.990
you'll be the first one I get rid of.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:16.970
What?

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.440
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.690
(Mingang Distribution)

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.510
If they had gotten rid of the vase,
it would be here.

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:49.870
Where in the world did it go?

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.790
Are you looking for something?

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.790
Excuse me, did you happen to clean
the chairman's office?

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.260
- I did.
- Did you see the vase on the desk?

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.440
- Here it is.
- Oh, gosh.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.940
The chairman told me to throw it out,
so I took it.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.880
It was so pretty,
so I wanted to take it home.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.340
Did I do something wrong?

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.580
No, you did the right thing.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:30.780
Thank you. Thank you so much.

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.120
- Did you find it?
- Right here.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.490
(Mingang Distribution)

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.110
Anything about Chairman Min?

00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:59.340
Not yet.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.980
They must have.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.510
Let's listen a little longer.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.750
There we go.
They're talking about Chairman Min.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.860
We're already planning to move him
to the outskirts of Gyeonggi Province.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:20.600
Shinyul Hospital
has a busy intersection out front.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.070
Besides, who would know about
the side road...

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.670
from the intersection to the highway?

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.200
Anyway, Lawyer Kim, you take care of it.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.840
I've got it. I know where Chairman Min is.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:34.440
Really? That's great.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:36.210
We have to move fast.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:38.820
If we're too slow,
they'll move him before we get there.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.530
What's going on?
Why are they in such a rush?

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:57.900
I know, right? They're not headed to
a motel again, are they?

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.040
What?

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.240
Yes, Director Oh.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:05.640
An emergency board meeting?

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.780
I wasn't notified.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.480
According to the other directors,

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.820
it's to approve Acting Chairman
Min Kyung Chae's promotion to Chairman.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.190
I'll call you back.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.360
An emergency board meeting?
What's that all about?

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:23.190
So she's really taking advantage of Dad
being gone to make her move.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.430
Once the board of directors meets
this afternoon,

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.940
you'll become the second chairman
of Mingang Distribution.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.740
How do you feel?

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:36.940
What's there to say?

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:41.040
It feels like I took the long road back
to where I belong.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.710
I guess we can start planning
our wedding now.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:45.680
That's after I'm officially the chairman,

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.150
and after I've cleaned house
at the company.

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:49.550
But surely,

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:52.090
you're not going to
back out on me now, are you?

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.690
- You really don't trust me, do you?
- I was just afraid you might forget.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:21:00.200
Let's not forget who handled the chairman
and called for an emergency board meeting,

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:04.070
who ensured you were officially appointed
chairman without a single hitch,

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.670
who volunteered to be the bad guy
and spearheaded this whole operation.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.770
Just don't forget it.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:12.240
Don't worry.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:13.940
I haven't forgotten.

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.050
I think this is the place.

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:24.920
Let's go in.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.990
The emergency meeting is this afternoon.
We must find Chairman Min before then...

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.400
and stop the board from approving her.

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:36.830
Wait a minute.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.300
This looks like a regular hospital.

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.340
Something feels off.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:14.970
You're right.
It does feel different, doesn't it?

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.780
But I'm sure the chairman
is in here somewhere.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.750
Lucia wouldn't do that to me.

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:28.620
But what if I'm wrong?

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:34.290
What if they're having an affair
behind my back?

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.830
I thought she would come if I waited.
Was that just wishful thinking?

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.500
I thought Lucia would come find me.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.310
Anyone but Lucia...

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.540
There are so many rooms.
It's going to take a while to check them.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:55.380
I wish the chairman would spot us first.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.180
Lucia?

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.350
In here!

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.160
Someone is in here!

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:06.490
Lucia!

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:08.260
Lucia, I'm in here!

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.600
- Chairman.
- Lucia? Is that really you?

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:18.030
- Is it really you standing before me?
- Yes, it's me.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.670
I had no idea you were in here.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.310
Just a moment. I'll get this door open.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.050
Chairman, are you all right?

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.790
Lucia, is it really you?

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.560
It's really you?

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.430
I'm here to save you, Chairman.

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:45.360
I knew it. I knew you'd come for me.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:47.330
I'm so glad you're safe, Chairman.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.070
Director Moon Tae Kyung
helped me find you.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.040
Your eldest daughter made it
hard to find you,

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.570
so the family couldn't step in.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:56.440
When I had no one else to turn to,

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:58.940
Director Moon Tae Kyung
stepped in to help.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.440
He said we had to find you
before it was too late.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.420
That punk, Lawyer Kim,
is the one who brought those.

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:14.260
I didn't believe it.
I knew it couldn't be true.

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:18.030
You two are the only people
in this world I trust.

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:22.000
We need to get out of here now.
They'll be here any minute.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.230
Your daughter called
an emergency board meeting...

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:25.870
to appoint herself
as the official chairman.

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.140
It's about to start.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.740
What? How can she,
when I'm still alive and well?

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:30.910
She's making herself chairman?

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:32.740
Not on my watch.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:34.340
We have to stop her.

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:39.620
- Be careful.
- Let's go.

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:52.600
I don't know how you got in here,

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.330
but you're not getting out so easily.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.740
Get them.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.120
What should I do?

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.220
The board meeting is about to start.

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:24.930
Director Min?

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.560
Vote for her.

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:28.870
Are you sure that's a good idea?

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.900
If Acting Chairman Min Kyung Chae
officially becomes chairman,

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.170
what happens to you
and your people, like me?

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:37.810
We're not...

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.010
going to get fired, are we?

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.610
Don't worry.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:46.080
I have another card
I can play against her.

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:49.820
Another card?

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:51.690
Se Ri.

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:53.690
If my hunch is right...

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.530
Wait, Se Ri?
What does she have to do with this?

00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.500
You'll see.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:05.040
We are here to appoint
our acting chairman, Min Kyung Chae,

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:07.700
as the new official chairman.

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:09.540
I would now like to ask the directors...

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.940
to please state your opinions
on the matter.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:16.280
Why drag this out? The outcome is obvious.

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:18.080
I couldn't agree more.

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:21.250
The directors have all been
on the same page for a while now.

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:23.890
Let's just skip to the vote.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.360
That's the clearest way to show
where we stand.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.060
If that's what the board members want,

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.490
we will proceed immediately.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:31.900
(Mingang Distribution)

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.700
It's finally over.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:37.130
Once I'm chairman,
no one will be able to take Mingang,

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.540
or my Se Ri, away from me.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:41.340
Just you watch, Father.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.610
Once I take control of Mingang,

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:45.080
I'll make you
pay for all the humiliation...

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.940
you've put me through.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.110
(Mingang Distribution)

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:51.550
Then let's proceed with the vote.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.520
All in favor of
Acting Chairman Min Kyung Chae...

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.790
as the next chairman,

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.490
please raise your hands.

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:22.450
It's unanimous.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.950
Very well. By unanimous decision,

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:26.650
Acting Chairman Min Kyung Chae...

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:30.590
is hereby appointed as the next chairman.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.900
Not so fast!

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.070
Who says she's chairman?

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.910
Father, how did you get here?

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:03.720
(Mingang Distribution)

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:09.860
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:26.510
You were the child I trusted the most.
Get out! Right now.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:30.680
Get out of my company and out of my house.
I never want to see your face again!

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:33.120
- She got a concussion from the fall.
- So what?

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:34.180
Does she need brain surgery?

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:36.990
It's dissociative amnesia from the shock.

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:38.220
Amnesia?

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.660
Do I know you?
I don't think we've ever met.

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:45.500
