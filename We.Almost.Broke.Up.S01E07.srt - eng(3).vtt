00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.520
(This is a work of fiction)

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.880
Shen Meng.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.240
Shen Meng.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.720
Shen Meng.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.720
Stop it.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.720
You can't wake her up.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.120
Let me get this straight.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.239
You and Shen Meng are stuck on the same day...

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.640
because you broke up.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.520
To get out of this day,

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.200
you have to complete the mission given by the projector.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.559
You've already completed four levels...

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.880
of what was projected.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.680
Now, it's the fifth level,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.400
kissing your ex.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.320
Dude.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.240
I knew you're the only one...

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.120
who would believe me.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.720
I get it now.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.920
Advanced intelligence.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.520
- Yes. - The Chosen One.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.400
- That's right. - An infinite loop, right?

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.560
That's exactly it.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.280
I understand your predicament.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.040
I won't stand by and do nothing.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.840
Tell me.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.080
What do you need me to do?

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.720
Shen Meng deleted my Contacts before,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.199
so I don't have any contact information of my exes.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.200
I do.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.800
I'll contact her for you.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.640
You're a good friend.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.560
What is your relationship...

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.400
with the person who called the police, Zhao Ming Xi?

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.320
He's my good friend.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.120
And why is Shen Meng,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.320
the one lying on the bed, unconscious?

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.960
I'd better not tell you.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.719
This story is too ridiculous.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.720
You won't believe it even if I tell you.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.720
You'll just laugh at me.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.280
Are you questioning our professionalism?

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.640
Tell us.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.880
Say it!

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.720
Chen Jia Wen.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.720
I think...

00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:01.201
we shouldn't waste each other's time.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.680
I will...

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.920
- give you 10 more minutes. - Give you 10 more minutes.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.800
Wait.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.480
How did you know what I'd say?

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.400
Goodbye, officers.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.840
Time is almost up.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.840
And your watch is ten seconds fast.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.320
We had a deal, okay?

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.960
It's all for passing the level.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.880
You can't blame me after waking up.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.320
You've had enough fun?

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.320
Don't explain.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.760
I know.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.320
It's hard to give me up.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.080
- Listen to me... - But no.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.080
Chen Jia Wen,

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.320
you have to forget about me.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.120
We both need to start...

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.680
a new life.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.440
You're right.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.680
But forgetting you is too hard for me.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.199
Every time I think about...

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.160
our beautiful memories together, I'd feel like...

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.000
my heart is being torn apart.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.240
So,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.680
give me another chance.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Okay?

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.400
Actually, I secretly made a vow...

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.840
that if you want to get back together with me within a year,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.680
I would definitely say yes.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.840
But now,

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.880
it's too late.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.960
It's not too late.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.920
You have to believe in our love.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.600
It can transcend time,

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.120
space, and reality.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.880
Everything can go back to how it used to be.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.720
It's not too late for anything.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.800
So trust me.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.480
Okay?

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.696
Do you think getting back together is that easy?

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.080
Pursue me again.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.176
We don't have to get back together yet,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.200
just kiss me!

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.800
This...

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.920
is my fault.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.520
- I shouldn't have come. - It's my fault.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.880
I shouldn't have asked to meet up.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.920
I stooped so low too.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.760
Why did I look at her phone for no reason?

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.600
I don't usually look at it.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.040
Once I did, I saw it.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.440
Man Li is my wife.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.280
As her husband,

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.280
I have to deal with this.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.280
I understand.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.920
I understand completely.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.720
Tell me.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.920
Why do you want to meet her?

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.320
Dude, it's nothing, really.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.680
Keep pretending.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.680
You're still pretending with us?

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.120
You should know...

00:06:59.121 --> 00:07:01.320
the kind of person Man Li is better than I do.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.440
In just going downstairs to pick up a package,

00:07:04.441 --> 00:07:05.841
she can add three people on WeChat.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.000
After just posting a selfie,

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.360
she'll get so many DMs.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Tell me what it is.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.160
I can handle it.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.440
Dude, I am...

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.040
a bit short on cash lately.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.000
I wanted to borrow some from her.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.600
You want to borrow money?

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.280
Who would believe that?

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.280
Dude.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.480
You know...

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.160
I...

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.800
don't have it easy.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.520
Dude, have pity on me.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.040
I'm begging you.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.360
Please don't contact my wife anymore, okay?

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.040
Dude.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.680
I'll delete her from my Contacts. I'll do it now.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.120
I've deleted her.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.560
Dude, you're so straightforward.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.720
I feel so much better now.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.920
All right, I'll leave you to it.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.536
I still have a few more people to meet.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.896
I have to deal with a few matters for her.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.920
Sit down.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.720
Drink it all.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.080
Take care, dude.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.160
Did you delete her alternate account?

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.680
Dude, I don't have her alternate account.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.440
Check it.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.400
Check it.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.120
I'm being narrow-minded.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.920
I'm so petty.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.800
Sit down.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.360
I didn't touch it. Drink it.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.960
Message me if you need anything.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.840
What are you waiting for?

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.080
Come on.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.520
You...

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.280
How should we kiss?

00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:10.200
For how long? With tongue?

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.080
Do you know the rules?

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.480
Is one kiss enough?

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.719
I have a lot on my plate today.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.440
I don't have time for unrelated things.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.160
I...

00:10:24.161 --> 00:10:25.441
Why don't we go to my place now?

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.360
There's no need...

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.840
Don't be shy with me.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.600
I'm not being shy.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.096
Then what are you dilly-dallying for?

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.256
Saving her is more important.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.360
Let's go to my place.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.999
Stop it. I'm not joking with you.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.040
Who's joking with you?

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.800
Forget it. I'll find someone else.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.400
Stop.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.320
Isn't it just a kiss?

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.520
It's no big deal.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.520
I didn't think...

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.680
you'd believe me.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.999
With your brain,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.520
you can't make up these lies.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.920
But let me remind you.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.136
If you really want to have a good relationship with her,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.160
don't say it was me.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.679
You've had so much fun in the past couple of days, right?

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.919
You're free now.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.240
And are you with Meng Meng now?

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.639
This is the kind of person you are. You're a jerk.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.640
You're a scumbag! Compensate me!

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.560
You're awake.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.240
Why are you eating popcorn?

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.520
I brought you a late-night snack.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.120
It was Fang Zhi You, right?

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.920
How did you know?

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.160
Aside from her,

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.320
who else would help you?

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.360
It's okay. We've already broken up.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.000
It's all for passing the level.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.080
I understand.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.000
If I were dying,

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.840
and you must kiss your ex-boyfriend,

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.600
what would you do then?

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.120
Don't change the subject.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.880
You're being unreasonable.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.600
How long was I out?

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.920
Not long.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Not long?

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.040
Who was it? It went so well?

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.120
You.

00:13:25.121 --> 00:13:26.799
- Me? - We've already broken up.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.800
You're my ex-boyfriend.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.960
You could exploit a loophole like that?
