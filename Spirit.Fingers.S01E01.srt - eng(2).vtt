00:22:16.433 --> 00:22:18.433
A worthwhile review.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.233
Ugh, what a weirdo!

00:22:45.633 --> 00:22:48.233
- Hey, grab her!
- Hey!

00:22:52.833 --> 00:22:54.667
Get up.

00:22:58.533 --> 00:23:00.167
Hey!

00:23:00.167 --> 00:23:02.067
You glared at me?

00:23:02.067 --> 00:23:03.233
No.

00:23:03.233 --> 00:23:04.633
No?

00:23:04.633 --> 00:23:07.567
Are you calling me a liar?

00:23:08.867 --> 00:23:10.700
What's this?

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:11.867
You're wearing contacts?

00:23:11.867 --> 00:23:13.467
You're so bad at makeup.

00:23:13.467 --> 00:23:14.867
First time wearing makeup?

00:23:14.867 --> 00:23:16.400
Did you follow a tutorial?

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.300
Hey!

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.200
Like drawing stripes on a watermelon.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.967
- Watermelon?
- Pumpkin!

00:23:21.967 --> 00:23:25.000
Whatever, no difference.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.567
When someone is talking, you should look at them.

00:23:29.567 --> 00:23:32.033
You just glared at me again, didn't you?

00:23:32.033 --> 00:23:34.767
No, I was just looking.

00:23:34.767 --> 00:23:36.533
Exactly.

00:23:36.533 --> 00:23:40.333
Why the heck were you
staring at me like that, brat?

00:23:43.333 --> 00:23:46.133
Because your lip tint looked pretty.

00:23:46.833 --> 00:23:47.933
She said the lip tint is pretty.

00:23:47.933 --> 00:23:50.033
Oh, pretty?

00:23:50.033 --> 00:23:51.333
Want to try some on yours too?

00:23:51.333 --> 00:23:52.667
I'll apply it nicely for you.

00:23:52.667 --> 00:23:54.133
- Wait!
- Hey, grab her!

00:23:54.133 --> 00:23:55.933
Stay still, please.

00:23:55.933 --> 00:23:58.700
Shut your mouth so I can apply it properly.

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.700
Hey, stay still or you'll get hurt.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.533
Ever since I was young,

00:24:04.533 --> 00:24:07.233
whenever I tried something new,

00:24:07.233 --> 00:24:10.567
I always made mistakes, whether big or small.

00:24:10.567 --> 00:24:13.400
When using new crayons for the first time,

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.700
when first trying jump rope,

00:24:17.667 --> 00:24:19.600
- When starting a new semester...
- Why are you home at this hour?

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.633
You peed again?

00:24:25.233 --> 00:24:27.067
My stomach hurts.

00:24:27.067 --> 00:24:28.533
On my first high school exam day...

00:24:28.533 --> 00:24:31.067
So will you take the college entrance exam?

00:24:31.067 --> 00:24:33.900
Maybe it'll be fine if I study for another year.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.867
Sounds like a good idea.

00:24:35.867 --> 00:24:37.567
Did you think I'd say that?

00:24:37.567 --> 00:24:40.033
Hey, Song U Yeon!

00:24:40.033 --> 00:24:43.900
Did you think I would be happy
if you said you're retaking the exam?

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.967
Just try retaking the exam, huh?

00:24:48.933 --> 00:24:50.667
Take good care of me.

00:24:50.667 --> 00:24:51.967
Why is she like that?

00:24:51.967 --> 00:24:53.267
They said she got new indoor shoes.

00:24:53.267 --> 00:24:58.233
I used to be so careful
that my friends would tease me about it.

00:24:58.233 --> 00:25:00.933
But today I was so excited

00:25:00.933 --> 00:25:04.100
that I forgot all the first-time experiences

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.133
required extra caution,

00:25:08.133 --> 00:25:11.000
and completely forgot everything.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:17.433
- Now, one, two, three...
- Two, three.

00:25:18.233 --> 00:25:19.933
Do you like it, Miss?

00:25:19.933 --> 00:25:22.200
Oh my god, a goddess appears.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.233
Awesome!

00:25:23.233 --> 00:25:24.533
Can I post this on InStar?

00:25:24.533 --> 00:25:26.867
- Hey, take it, take it!
- Lift your chin.

00:25:26.867 --> 00:25:28.467
Smile a little.

00:25:28.467 --> 00:25:31.200
I even used expensive products. This won't do.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.100
What? You don't like it?

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.633
Hey!

Watch where you look next time.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.733
And buy some decent clothes.

What a relief.

I thought I was gonna die from fear...

00:25:57.867 --> 00:26:00.000
Relief?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
You call this situation a relief?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.867
What's there to be relieved about?
You coward! You idiot!

Yeah, he's a stranger anyway. Let's just go.

00:27:19.933 --> 00:27:22.833
But he told me to wait.

00:27:22.833 --> 00:27:24.333
And you wait just because he said to?

00:27:24.333 --> 00:27:25.867
Why would he ask me to wait?

00:27:25.867 --> 00:27:27.133
Wait?

Or not?

This is driving me crazy!

00:27:41.567 --> 00:27:43.733
What?

00:27:43.733 --> 00:27:45.900
You told me to wait.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.067
Are you stupid?

Hey, just because someone says wait,
you actually wait? Wow, unbelievable.

I am just looking normally.

It's the staring contest.

00:28:26.333 --> 00:28:28.267
Staring contest?

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.200
Win the eye battle
and you've half-won already. Got it?

00:32:43.767 --> 00:32:45.300
- Darn it!
- Darn it!

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.033
I think he's just fed up
because of his older sister.

00:32:47.033 --> 00:32:48.633
Sister?

00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:50.467
Hey, what time is it?

00:32:50.467 --> 00:32:51.800
- Dunno.
- It's 3 o'clock.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.833
It's 3 o'clock?

00:32:53.833 --> 00:32:55.467
We're doomed!

00:32:55.467 --> 00:32:57.433
Where are you going?

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.533
Señorita.

00:33:49.533 --> 00:33:51.533
Hello.

00:33:57.467 --> 00:34:00.133
Hi!

00:34:01.033 --> 00:34:03.200
Can I pet it?

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.500
Sure.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:07.867
Oh, it's so fluffy and cute! So adorable!

00:34:07.867 --> 00:34:09.800
What's its name?

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.767
'Bigfoot.'

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.267
Your paws are huge!

00:34:15.267 --> 00:34:17.067
So cute!

00:34:17.067 --> 00:34:19.033
Bye, Bigfoot. See you later.

00:34:19.033 --> 00:34:22.100
What can I do for you?

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:24.233
Is there a drawing club...

00:34:24.233 --> 00:34:27.100
So you're SF's new member.

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:28.033
Yes.

00:34:28.033 --> 00:34:30.633
Go that way and you'll find the hallway.

00:34:30.633 --> 00:34:33.200
Enter the blue door at the very end.

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.267
Thank you.

00:34:53.033 --> 00:34:55.033
So cool.

00:35:02.133 --> 00:35:05.067
This place is really amazing.

00:35:05.067 --> 00:35:07.233
This is fun.

00:35:13.867 --> 00:35:17.467
The blue door. This is the place, right?

00:36:11.533 --> 00:36:14.567
Huh? You're here?

00:36:15.333 --> 00:36:17.267
Honey,

00:36:17.267 --> 00:36:19.600
can't you hear me?

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.400
Honey!

00:36:27.833 --> 00:36:30.233
Why are you just standing there?

00:36:30.233 --> 00:36:33.000
I won't bite, come in.

00:36:34.667 --> 00:36:36.767
Hello!

00:36:38.467 --> 00:36:39.833
Hello!

00:36:39.833 --> 00:36:41.933
I'm the president of Spirit Fingers, Mint Finger.

00:36:41.933 --> 00:36:44.500
I'm the vice president, Blue Finger.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:45.833
I'm Pink Finger.

00:36:45.833 --> 00:36:46.933
Black Finger.

00:36:46.933 --> 00:36:48.100
I'm Khaki Finger.

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.367
I'm Brown Finger.

00:36:50.367 --> 00:36:52.100
I love brown the most.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.433
Was it a waste coming here?

00:36:56.533 --> 00:36:58.933
Mint.

00:36:59.467 --> 00:37:01.433
Blue.

00:37:01.433 --> 00:37:03.967
Pink.

00:37:03.967 --> 00:37:06.767
Our group calls each other
by color nicknames, like this.

00:37:06.767 --> 00:37:09.300
You need to come up with one too.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:12.700
Do you have a favorite color?

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:17.800
No, not really.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.033
I don't really have a favorite color.

00:37:20.033 --> 00:37:21.067
No.

00:37:21.067 --> 00:37:22.533
Everyone has a color.

00:37:22.533 --> 00:37:23.733
You just haven't found it yet.

00:37:23.733 --> 00:37:27.167
Until next time, make sure you find it. Okay?

00:37:27.167 --> 00:37:28.200
Okay.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:32.133
Alright, to celebrate our new member,
let's bring back an old tradition.

00:37:32.133 --> 00:37:36.600
- To a member who forgets history...
- There is no future!

00:37:40.064 --> 00:37:42.400
Let me help you with that.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:46.633
Now, let's begin the briefing
on Spirit Fingers' history.

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:51.000
So, in the beginning,

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.733
Koo Seon Ho and I started it
as a study group. Just the two of us.

00:37:53.733 --> 00:37:56.500
Hey guys, let's draw some pictures.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:57.800
- No.
- Ugh, no.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.800
- No.
- No.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.267
Every time we asked the school kids,
we got rejected.

00:38:02.267 --> 00:38:04.100
So we had to start on our own.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.433
Of course, it was fun at first.

00:38:06.433 --> 00:38:10.067
But then we got to the point where
we'd want to throw up just looking at each other.

00:38:10.067 --> 00:38:13.100
That's when we decided to recruit more members.

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:17.433
The first member was Pink,
who was a regular at our cafe.

00:38:20.967 --> 00:38:22.367
Miss,

00:38:22.367 --> 00:38:24.667
we need about three minutes of your time.

00:38:24.667 --> 00:38:27.433
Could you model for us just once?

00:38:27.433 --> 00:38:29.433
I don't do that kind of thing, kid.

00:38:29.433 --> 00:38:32.200
Oh, Miss.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.967
I apologize.

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:40.600
Just ask me anything.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:41.867
I'll do whatever you want.

00:38:41.867 --> 00:38:42.867
Because I'm your Miss.

00:38:42.867 --> 00:38:44.800
Like this, like this, poof!

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.067
Like this?

00:38:46.067 --> 00:38:49.567
[Jin Bun Hong, 41 years old, hiking gear seller]

00:38:49.567 --> 00:38:51.700
Is anyone here?

00:38:56.433 --> 00:38:59.133
Where did the owner go?

00:39:03.233 --> 00:39:05.433
Pretty.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.967
The second member was Black.

00:39:11.967 --> 00:39:14.500
I like your reactions.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.867
I'll graciously join your little club.

00:39:17.867 --> 00:39:19.400
[Go Taeng Ja, presumed to be in her 30s,
runs a punk shop]

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.700
- Stay strong!
- Cheers!

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:25.367
Hyuk, you're here?

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:30.400
The third member was Khaki,
Koo Seon Ho's roommate.

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.833
Let's keep it short and sweet.

00:39:37.833 --> 00:39:40.200
[Kwon Hyuk, 20 years old, game design major]

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:48.733
You need to take this.

00:39:48.733 --> 00:39:51.100
The fourth member was Brown.

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:52.900
[Jang Dong Geon, 40 years old, office worker]

00:39:58.733 --> 00:40:00.767
And finally, U Yeon.

00:40:00.767 --> 00:40:04.767
And that's how our dream team came together.

00:40:09.067 --> 00:40:11.467
These people are weird.

00:40:12.067 --> 00:40:13.700
Oh, but this...

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:19.300
Wearing a school uniform at my age
It's a bit embarrassing.

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:20.567
It looks good on you, Dong Geon.

00:40:20.567 --> 00:40:21.767
You've got that student council president vibe.

00:40:21.767 --> 00:40:25.633
Is that so? I was even vice president once.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.933
Hey, why are your pants so short?

00:40:27.933 --> 00:40:29.267
Did you grow taller again?

00:40:29.267 --> 00:40:30.300
Seems like it.

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:34.033
You can still grow at 20.

00:40:34.033 --> 00:40:35.200
Bun Hong, you're amazing.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.300
Where did you get that
pink school uniform? It's so cute.

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:41.333
Come on, this is just the basics.

00:40:41.333 --> 00:40:42.233
Mint,

00:40:42.233 --> 00:40:43.833
is your uniform oversized?

00:40:43.833 --> 00:40:46.533
Dude, I was a big girl back in high school.

00:40:46.533 --> 00:40:48.400
Ask Blue for the details.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.700
This dress code is surprisingly tough.

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:54.733
I had to close the shop
just to pick from twenty outfits.

00:40:54.733 --> 00:40:56.667
School Uniform Special.

00:40:56.667 --> 00:41:00.233
I had my doubts, but this is what it meant.

00:41:00.233 --> 00:41:02.867
But is wearing a school uniform really that fun?

00:41:02.867 --> 00:41:05.400
I'm so sick of this.

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.267
Did I come dressed
like the only one who's not having fun?

00:41:12.067 --> 00:41:14.800
But still, don't you think real students
are the prettiest?

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:18.800
Stop saying stuff like that. It's embarrassing.

00:41:20.233 --> 00:41:21.200
So pretty.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.967
Isn't it only natural that you're pretty?

00:41:22.967 --> 00:41:26.967
Still, the time you shine brightest in life

00:41:26.967 --> 00:41:29.067
is your school days.

00:41:29.733 --> 00:41:32.067
It's more beautiful

00:41:32.067 --> 00:41:34.633
because you can never go back.

00:41:35.867 --> 00:41:38.933
I miss my high school days.

00:41:38.933 --> 00:41:42.367
Are you two starting
with the cheesy sentiments again?

00:41:51.967 --> 00:41:53.000
Are you crying, U Yeon?

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.200
Did I upset you?

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:57.267
I didn't mean to tease you.

00:41:57.267 --> 00:41:58.733
No.

00:41:58.733 --> 00:42:01.333
No, it's not that.

00:42:02.033 --> 00:42:04.167
Why?

00:42:04.167 --> 00:42:07.533
Your words were just so touching.

00:42:10.267 --> 00:42:11.900
Oh, sorry! Sorry!

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.100
So that's what it was.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:16.533
Thanks to you, I'm wearing a uniform
for the first time in 20 years.

00:42:16.533 --> 00:42:17.700
Thank you. Thank you.

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.133
Thank you.

00:42:19.133 --> 00:42:21.733
They're so weird.

00:42:25.167 --> 00:42:27.833
But why

00:42:27.833 --> 00:42:30.400
do I feel like I'm going to like them?

00:42:31.267 --> 00:42:32.800
Where's today's model anyway?

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.267
Did that punk forget again?

00:42:35.267 --> 00:42:36.300
Who else is coming?

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:39.167
Uh, Geu Rin's younger brother.

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.500
- He arrived fast.
- Why is this room so blue?

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.133
You're here.

00:42:53.133 --> 00:42:54.467
Gi Jeong. It's been a while.

00:42:54.467 --> 00:42:56.167
Huh?

00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:00.067
- Like this!
- Chicken!

00:43:00.067 --> 00:43:02.900
What? Why is he here?

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:05.167
Wait, was it him?

00:43:05.167 --> 00:43:06.833
U Yeon, today's model

00:43:06.833 --> 00:43:07.867
is my brother.

00:43:07.867 --> 00:43:09.133
I'm doomed!

00:43:09.133 --> 00:43:11.633
Ah, right. He's your age, too.

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:32.333
Are you feeling shy now?

00:43:32.333 --> 00:43:34.100
So he's your type.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:37.400
What? No, I'm not.

00:43:40.233 --> 00:43:42.233
I get how U Yeon feels.

00:43:42.233 --> 00:43:47.833
Gi Jeong is so handsome sometimes
it makes you do a double take.

00:43:49.467 --> 00:43:51.967
You've been hit by Cupid's arrow.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.067
Please, stop it. He's already full of himself.

00:43:56.067 --> 00:43:57.433
What can I do about being handsome?

00:43:57.433 --> 00:43:59.933
You, Green Pig!

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.900
Let us siblings have a warm, affectionate chat.

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:07.700
Wait! Wait!

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.433
He didn't recognize me?

00:44:16.467 --> 00:44:20.167
Right, there's no way he would.

00:44:20.167 --> 00:44:21.800
I don't know.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:25.333
He definitely doesn't recognize me.

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:31.433
This color

00:44:31.433 --> 00:44:34.700
was exactly what I thought of
when I first saw you.

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:35.833
Baby Blue.

00:44:35.833 --> 00:44:37.800
Is Baby Blue a color too?

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.950
Baby Blue.

00:44:40.567 --> 00:44:41.633
It's pretty.

00:44:41.633 --> 00:44:43.167
What do you think? If not...

00:44:43.167 --> 00:44:46.133
No! I love it.

00:44:47.633 --> 00:44:49.533
Let's go with this color.

00:44:49.533 --> 00:44:50.600
Baby Blue.

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.433
Perfect!
