1
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,280
Yuyan

2
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,959
When did you start liking Meng Yan?

3
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,200
Me?

4
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,319
When I was ten.

5
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,239
Do you dare to kiss Meng Yan?

6
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,560
I do.

7
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:21,799
I'll kiss him, no problem.

8
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:35,719
Come on.

9
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:36,879
You only dare to kiss his cheek.

10
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,400
I can kiss Meng Yan on the lips, believe it?

11
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:39,760
I'll show you.

12
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,359
Fine.

13
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,079
I liked him before you did.

14
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,439
I liked him when I was nine.

15
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,000
If you love deeply, you have to drink it all.

16
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,520
Let me ask you.

17
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,800
Who do you like more, me or Tang Yuyan?

18
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,360
I really don't know.

19
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,199
With both of you,

20
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,800
it feels different being together.

21
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,639
When I'm with Yuyan,

22
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,439
I feel more relaxed.

23
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,000
With Yuer,

24
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,400
it's more fun.

25
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,719
So,

26
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,240
I really don't know who I like more.

27
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,400
All I know is,

28
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,840
that night with Jin Zhenghao,

29
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,360
you must've enjoyed it.

30
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,879
I didn't.

31
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:04,800
Kiss like this.

32
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,000
You try it too.

33
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,800
How about I...

34
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:09,960
Alright.

35
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:11,199
I'll drink.

36
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,080
I'll drink it all.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,879
Okay.

38
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,199
That's it for this round.

39
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,680
Let's play a new game.

40
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:19,800
What is it?

41
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
Loser does what the winner says.

42
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,960
Put on these clothes.

43
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,800
Oh wow.

44
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,960
Youth is wonderful.

45
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,919
This young couple,

46
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,800
now they're a trio.

47
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,560
What should we do now?

48
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,680
Go ahead and eat.

49
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,599
Why are you just staring at your bowls?

50
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,159
Eat.

51
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,120
We're eating.

52
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,759
Why so quiet today?

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,160
Last night was exhausting.

54
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,199
What are you talking about?

55
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,240
What did I say?

56
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,920
You chased me and hit me for half an hour yesterday.

57
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,800
I asked if you got tired from hitting me.

58
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,079
What did you think I meant?

59
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,360
Who knows what you meant?

60
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,759
Why are you so fierce?

61
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,639
Last night,

62
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,279
I heard you in your room.

63
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,680
You sounded so gentle.

64
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,839
Even gentler than Yuyan.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,560
Just eat your breakfast.

66
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,079
I'm done talking.

67
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,240
Not saying anymore.

68
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,199
Meng Yan

69
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,000
Finished eating?

70
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,160
Come with me.

71
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,319
Okay.

72
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,759
Meng Yan

73
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:32,759
Uncle Jia

74
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,439
I really didn't do anything last night.

75
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
Close your eyes.

76
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:38,879
You.

77
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,839
Take a deep breath.

78
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,680
Calm your mind.

79
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,879
Your Meng family's power,

80
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,480
look what you've done with it.

81
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,279
Your dad would be rolling in his grave.

82
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,399
Close your eyes.

83
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:55,879
Breathe.

84
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,800
Whenever you get emotional,

85
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,199
do you feel your power

86
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,480
suddenly gets stronger?

87
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,560
That's right.

88
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,560
Many people think

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,199
power battles are all about spiritual power.

90
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,160
Just relying on spiritual power,

91
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,079
you can crush your opponent.

92
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,360
Isn't that true?

93
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,839
Try it on me.

94
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,879
I've made a breakthrough.

95
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,959
Is that enough for you?

96
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,160
See if you can control my movements.

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,319
You.

98
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,040
Kid.

99
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,360
Control your focus.

100
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,959
Relax.

101
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,120
The emptier your mind,

102
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,079
the more you sense your power

103
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,560
flowing inside you.

104
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,399
Adjust your breathing.

105
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:19,000
Sync your breath with your heartbeat.

106
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,639
Remember.

107
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,000
I'll do my part.

108
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,399
You do yours.

109
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,279
Don't dodge.

110
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:33,560
Got it?

111
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,000
I did it.

112
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,439
I made it.

113
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,560
Don't get cocky.

114
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,759
If you reach your father's level,

115
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,560
maybe you could take on Shen Tianyi.

116
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,439
But right now,

117
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,959
if you really fight him,

118
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,199
you'd have, at best, a twenty percent chance.

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,759
Two out of a hundred.

120
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:14,800
Uncle Jia,

121
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,240
is Shen Tianyi really that powerful?

122
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,279
It's like the gap between us and ordinary people.

123
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,120
Second dimension—

124
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,000
unable to affect the third dimension.

125
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,560
Unless we ourselves

126
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,759
consciously lower our standards,

127
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,600
so ordinary people can interact with us,

128
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,159
otherwise,

129
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,480
they'll never sense

130
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,559
our spiritual power.

131
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,399
Why are you helping me?

132
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,000
You're practically my nephew-in-law.

133
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,960
As your uncle,

134
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,639
who else would I help?

135
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,080
Besides,

136
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,200
my older brother died mysteriously too.

137
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,279
You suspect

138
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,799
your brother's death is linked to Shen Tianyi?

139
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,399
I have no proof.

140
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,440
But logically,

141
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,480
whoever gained the most from it

142
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,320
is the prime suspect.

143
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,799
After my brother died,

144
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,840
half of the Jia family's assets

145
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,759
ended up with Shen Tianyi.

146
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,120
Even if he didn't do it himself,

147
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,399
he's still involved.

148
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,879
Don't tell Jia Yuer.

149
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,559
With her personality,

150
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,240
if she hears it's about Shen Tianyi,

151
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,840
she'll rush in headfirst.

152
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,759
Our Jia family

153
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,960
is a single heir on vast land.

154
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,600
Jia Yuer is our only daughter.

155
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,759
If anything happens to her,

156
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,840
my brother would haunt me at night.

157
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,799
By the way,

158
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,600
that bottle of tiger bone wine last night—

159
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,399
did it work?

160
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,600
Tiger bone wine?

161
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:07,600
What tiger bone wine?

162
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,960
So it was wasted.

163
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,320
I'm leaving.

164
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,480
Remember:

165
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,480
stay calm.

166
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,120
Use your head.

167
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,360
Uncle Jia,

168
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,240
the spiritual energy in these junk soulstones is too weak.

169
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,720
This spiritual power is nowhere near enough.

170
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,120
I don't have time to wait anymore.

171
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,960
Meng Yan.

172
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,080
Uncle.

173
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:19,039
There's still something I want to ask you.

174
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,200
Go ahead.

175
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,559
Master Xie Qi's power—

176
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,159
I still don't get it.

177
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,759
The day we took out the Meng family,

178
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,600
I don't recall him making a move.

179
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,039
But

180
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,360
Meng family's men had their limbs slashed instantly,

181
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,399
and their throats cut out of nowhere.

182
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,200
How did he do that?

183
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,080
You'll find out.

184
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,799
I've heard plenty about Master Xie Qi's methods.

185
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,360
But

186
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,559
his habits are truly disgusting.

187
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:52,679
Uncle,

188
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,919
someone like that—

189
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,120
no matter how strong, can't be trusted.

190
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,399
Don't judge others.

191
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,360
Or you'll be judged yourself.

192
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,960
How you judge others behind their back

193
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,399
is how others will judge you.

194
