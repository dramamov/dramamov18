=Episode 2=

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.430
Madam Xu,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.960
in broad daylight,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.750
what are you doing hiding here?

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.230
I...

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.840
In broad daylight,

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.840
why are you barging
into a lady's boudoir?

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.350
This is your room?

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.330
Men and women should keep a distance.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:06.950
Please leave at once.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.710
Answer me truthfully.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.760
I might spare your life.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.480
I've missed you so much.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.520
Hurry up.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.790
Shh.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.510
Why so impatient?

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.310
Leaving your undergarments
in such a visible spot.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.680
Come on.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.910
Put it on.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.350
If I put it on now,

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.230
you'll ruin it later.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.990
What's wrong?

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.680
Don't you like it?

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.550
You're so naughty.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.680
(According to popular rumor,)

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.150
(Commander Pei of the Jinlin Guards,)

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.590
(ranked only second to His Majesty,)

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.100
(possesses unparalleled martial arts,)

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.840
(yet suffers from impotence.)

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.760
(Letting him witness this)

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.180
(might be agonizing,)

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.920
(perhaps it's better not
to let him hear it.)

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.560
(Madam Xu catching her husband
in an affair)

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.360
(must be agonizing for her.)

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.310
(Better to take her away quickly.)

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.240
Hey.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.080
Let's go.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.320
Speak.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.550
What are you sneaking around
in someone else's room for?

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.430
I was just delivering some incense.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.240
What about you?

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.880
Aren't you also in someone else's room?

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.080
Comman...

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.920
Young Master.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.400
(He's deliberately hiding his identity.)

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.190
In broad daylight, you wear a mask,

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.710
hiding yourself from sight.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.750
Could it be

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.430
that you two climbed over the wall
to steal something?

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.870
No need.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.800
Commander.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.160
She runs, but the Mansion remains.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.430
I'll go there to arrest her.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.310
No need.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.000
I want to see

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.470
what she can do

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.800
under my watch.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.430
(Xu Wanning,)

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.910
(the most cunning woman in the capital.)

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.120
(Interesting.)

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.990
(Luckily, he didn't follow me again.)

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:40.870
(No matter what,)

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.890
(it's better not to meet)

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.360
(that cold-faced Yama again.)

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.200
My Lady,

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.120
the pharmacy delivered a batch
of Guiku Herb.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.560
Have a few people make them
into sachets.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.060
Each servant and maid in the courtyard

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.120
carries one with them.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.280
Yes, My Lady.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.380
The matter with the midwife
happened too long ago

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.410
and still needs some time.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.990
It's getting chilly in late autumn,

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.800
please keep warm.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.430
Thank you.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.850
- Go now.
- Alright.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.710
That wretch

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.150
died in the first snow six years ago.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.360
It's already late autumn.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.680
I must hurry.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.550
I must do it before the snow falls.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.870
Did you place the incense
I asked you to put

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.720
in Xu Wanning's room?

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.430
I did it long ago.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.160
But today, she seemed a bit unusual.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.800
Early this morning,

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.440
she said she was going to the pharmacy.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.400
It seems

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.660
it's starting to take effect.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.950
Once she contracts Corpse Blossom Rash,

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.000
she won't be able to go out anymore.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.600
By then,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.920
I can see Ping every day.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:46.670
By the way,

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.430
how has Ping been lately?

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.510
Has he mentioned me?

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.270
Apart from some restless sleep,

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.310
everything else is as usual.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.500
I have some fine incense here,

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.990
which can calm the mind and aid sleep.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.160
You take it to him to use.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.560
Can a child use incense?

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.780
Wanning never lets him near such things.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.040
She's just unwilling to spend it
on the child.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.480
He is not her biological child.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.160
It's always different in such cases.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.230
Alright.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.160
I'll use it for him when I return.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.000
Is that OK?

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.920
(Guiku Herb can prevent
the Corpse Blossom Rash.)

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:43.670
(In this lifetime,)

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.870
(I won't let you succeed.)

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.100
(Marquis's Mansion in Yan City)

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.270
My face!

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:55.870
Ping,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.000
what's wrong?

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:58.830
What's wrong with your face?

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.320
(This scent...)

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.830
(Could it be that Cui Qingping used it?)

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.910
Ping.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.040
Ping.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.320
Let me see.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:11.310
Your face.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.360
Wanning,

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.680
as a mother,

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.390
how do you take care of your child?

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.190
How dare you! As a mother,

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.610
you failed in caring for the child.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.330
And you still dare to hit your husband.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.680
Have you no sense of propriety?

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.160
I repeatedly reminded him

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.160
that Ping is frail

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.630
and his room must not be scented.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.960
What is this?

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.240
What kind of incense is this?

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.360
Feng,

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.680
what did you use?

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.630
Mother, this incense isn't mine.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.720
Bai Qingqing insisted on it.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.560
Enough.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.920
This is not the time to blame anyone.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.190
What matters now is Ping's condition.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.800
Have you called for a doctor?

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.800
Ping just has some spots on his face.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.600
A few doses of medicine should heal him.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.880
Ping,

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.040
I will get your medicine, alright?

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.560
No, I don't need your help.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.160
You're not my mother. Go away.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.480
Ping.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.870
I've worked tirelessly to raise you.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.680
If I'm not your mother,

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.070
then who is?

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.520
Tell me.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.350
Fine.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.590
Since that's the case,

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.270
I'll be leaving, alright?

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.000
Wanning, don't take it to heart.
He's just a child.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.160
He's sick and talking nonsense.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.040
Wanning,

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.720
you are his mother.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.360
Now that he is ill,

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.190
you can't just stand by

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.240
and do nothing.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.360
I don't understand medicine.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:29.480
He is sick.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.780
We should leave it to the doctor.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.750
I certainly won't stand idly by.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.070
I'll go to the temple

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.600
and pray that Ping gets better soon.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.310
(That's right.)

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.160
(It was the same in the previous life.)

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.800
(Ping fell ill.)

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.770
(We went to the temple
to draw divination lots,)

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.430
(but it turned out to be a trap
of usurping the nest.)

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.760
Master.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.120
If you wish for your child's safety,

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.870
the person in blue can help you.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.070
The person in blue can help us?

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.430
The person in blue?

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.160
Master, who is she?

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.240
This is

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.830
a lay disciple who practices
in the temple.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.320
Since fate has brought you together,

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:24.800
why not let her stay at the mansion
for a few days,

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.370
copying scriptures and chanting prayers,

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.750
and bringing blessings to you?

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.910
Wanning,

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.190
this is heaven's will.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.270
The person in Blue is right
before our eyes.

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:34.510
Miss,

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.630
the Master said you are the savior
of our family.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.200
I beg you to save my child.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.200
Thank you.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.150
The divination lot seems to suggest

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:10.510
that our family must welcome a woman
into our home.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.550
Only then can this calamity be averted.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:14.750
Really?

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:15.710
Who?

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.200
It's her.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.120
Miss, what is your name?

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.150
I am Bai Qingqing.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.200
And you are?

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.960
I am the Madam of the Marquis's Mansion.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.150
I am Xu Wanning.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.390
This is my husband, Cui Yunfeng.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.790
This is Lady Cui.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.390
Greetings, Lady Cui.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.720
Greetings, Marquis Cui.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.040
Madam.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.120
Qingqing,

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.550
I have a request to make.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:46.960
I would like you

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:48.480
to move into the Marquis's Mansion

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.240
and become my husband's

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:51.510
sworn sister.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:52.960
Sworn sister?

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.110
Hmm.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.030
My Lady,

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.100
if the Marquis were
to marry his sworn sister

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.550
to bring Miss Bai into the household,

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.790
I'm afraid it might invite gossip
from outsiders.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.510
Hongmei,

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:04.790
Qingqing

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.510
is a noble lady who can assist Ping.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.630
Does it really matter
what outsiders say?

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.030
Qingqing, don't overthink it.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.840
Hongmei is only thinking of you.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.870
After all, you're still a maiden.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:17.240
Reputation is indeed important.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.550
What are you suggesting, Madam?

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:24.720
How about this?

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:28.480
You swear before Buddha today,

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.910
promising to remain pure
as siblings for life

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.720
and never betray me. What do you think?

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.270
Wanning,

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.200
do I really need to swear?

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.480
Indeed, Wanning.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.750
I don't think it's necessary.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.800
Mother,

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.320
you have always been devoted to Buddha.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.320
You understand this best.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.910
This still requires an oath.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.200
Wanning, how should I do?

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.750
As for it...

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.080
Yunfeng, you swear like this:

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.840
you will maintain a pure relationship

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.390
with Qingqing in this lifetime

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:00.390
and never cross the line.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.140
Otherwise,

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.390
you will be struck by lightning
and meet a terrible end.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.840
This is all for Ping's sake.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:11.870
Hurry up, Yunfeng.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.080
Buddha is watching.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:23.000
I, Cui Yunfeng, hereby swear,

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.550
I will remain pure
with my sworn sister Bai Qingqing,

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.590
and never cross the line.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.190
Otherwise, may I be struck by lightning,

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:29.130
and meet a terrible end.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.320
Why is it suddenly raining?

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.200
Qingqing.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.670
Thank you, Qingqing.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:38.510
Please.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.360
Well...

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.150
I swear,

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.440
I will remain a pure relationship
with the Marquis

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.440
and never cross the line.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.380
If I do, may I be struck by lightning,

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.600
and meet a terrible end.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.550
Since that's the case,

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.150
from today onward,

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.440
you are the Marquis's sister,

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:04.870
and thus my sister as well.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:06.600
It happens to be raining today,

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.120
so let's stay here,

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.510
and pray for Ping' well-being.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.000
Tomorrow we'll return
to the Marquis's Mansion.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.080
How does that sound?

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.390
Thank you again, Qingqing.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.270
(This time,)

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:21.790
(since you're here,)

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.390
(don't think of leaving so easily.)

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.870
Wanning.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.560
Wanning.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:48.780
(Guanyin Hall)

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:49.790
Don't touch me.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.030
Wasn't I supposed to be a noble lady?

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.630
How did I become your sworn sister?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.510
It's just a title, nothing more.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.270
Once you enter the Mansion,

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.510
you can see Ping and me every day.

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:00.600
That's what truly matters.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.910
Alright, don't be upset.

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.510
Then I'll serve you properly

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:04.710
right here in front of Buddha.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:10.950
Buddha, please forgive me.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.360
I dare not act recklessly.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.480
I will never disrespect you again.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:15.710
Buddha, please forgive me.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:16.940
Buddha, please forgive me.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.510
Yunfeng, are you alright?

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.440
Don't touch me.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.720
Go, fetch me a pair of trousers.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.040
Alright.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.080
(What a scoundrel.)

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.250
(Let's see if you dare to meet her
in the temple.)

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.550
Buddha, please forgive us.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:52.960
It's you.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.480
I didn't expect you
to be so knowledgeable,

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.910
even having expertise
in such an obscure skill

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.790
as making cannons
with sulfur and bamboo tubes.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.790
I am the Marquis's wife.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.840
It's so late.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.230
You don't belong here.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:10.110
Shh.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.870
Keep your voice down.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.510
If someone outside hears you,

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.670
they might think
you're having an affair.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:20.750
What are you doing here?

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.000
You are well-versed in medicine.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.320
Now you're acting suspiciously.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.120
Do you have forbidden medicine on you?

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:32.580
How could I possibly have something
like that?

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.440
I'll find out soon enough.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:43.840
