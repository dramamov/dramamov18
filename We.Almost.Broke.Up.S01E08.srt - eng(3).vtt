00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.520
(This is a work of fiction)

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.760
Miss, you're awake?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.360
- Miss. - What the heck!

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.560
Who are you?

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.360
A younger man.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.056
Do you have a younger brother?

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.080
No.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.360
You're secretly looking at handsome guys.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.040
They're of different types.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.760
They're just mealtime videos.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.200
Who do you choose between me and him?

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.600
You.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.600
- What about him? - You.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
What about him?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
You.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.440
You have to believe me.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.080
You're the only man I love in this world.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.480
My heart only flutters for you.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.920
Really?

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.520
I got it.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.280
He's the challenge for this level.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.720
The No Heart Flutter Challenge.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.856
As long as my heart doesn't flutter,

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.000
I'll pass this level.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.680
Then why did it reset just now?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.800
I was...

00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:20.200
I was startled just now.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.600
Someone suddenly appeared.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.480
Miss, it's all my fault.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.800
Don't be angry.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.400
Well...

00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:28.480
Let me show you something.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.360
When you're unhappy in the future,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.800
come to me.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.200
I'll be at your beck and call.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.440
The last step.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.160
Miss, look.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.960
Go away.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.040
I'm tired.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.760
What do you want to eat later?

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.760
- I... - I'll make it, miss.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.960
The fish is ready.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.960
Do we have fish at home?

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.880
There's... There's no fish at home.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.040
Miss, eat it.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.999
You eat it. You had a hard time making this.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
It wasn't hard on me.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.479
I'll peel the shrimp for you then.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.839
There's no need. I'll do it myself.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.840
I can peel it very quickly.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.840
Just eat.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.960
Miss, have some.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.400
Here, miss.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.600
Tell me. Where did you come from?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.400
You're such a service professional.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.320
Chen Jia Wen.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.160
Why don't you...

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.080
go out for a while?

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.599
This is my house. Why should I go out?

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.839
It's my house too.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.959
If you're here, you'll get in my way...

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.016
of passing the level quickly.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.600
I can't leave him alone at home.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.280
So you don't trust me.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.240
Nice, Shen Meng.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.079
You were up there for over an hour.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.080
What did he do to you?

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.200
Things you can't give me.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.520
What things?

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.080
Emotional value.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.320
What is that?

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.520
Ms. Shen, the chairman is already waiting for you.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.120
Please get in.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.320
- Ms. Shen? - Yes.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.520
The chairman has already acquired your company.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.200
Wait for me.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.840
Ms. Shen, this way, please.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.960
- Hello, Ms. Shen. - Hi, Ms. Shen.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.920
Hello, Ms. Shen.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.440
- Hello... - Gosh.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.120
Ms. Shen, you're here. Hello, Ms. Shen.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.320
Hi, Ms. Shen.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.960
Are you sure I am the general manager of this company?

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.040
Yes.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.800
Let her be a live streamer.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.240
- She has great potential. - Thank you, Ms. Shen.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.280
Take care, Ms. Shen.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.040
Watch your step, Ms. Shen.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.440
Come and sit down.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.760
Where should I sit?

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.400
Why are you dodging me?

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.200
The second button on my shirt...

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.040
fits perfectly into your wiggly eyelashes.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.800
Wait.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.720
Don't choke me. Let's talk first.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.040
You're really different from other women.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.160
What should I do with you?

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.640
You're being too cheesy.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.199
What are you doing? Why are you're stripping here?

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.760
What would people say if they see this?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.760
Why do you like stripping so much?

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.600
Let go of her.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.320
Who are you?

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.080
A domineering CEO.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.120
Who are you?

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.040
I don't care who you are.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.136
I'll give you five million.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.160
Leave Xiao Meng.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.400
Five million?

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.320
You're belittling me.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.520
Name your price.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.800
- Ten million. - I don't have that.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.680
You don't even have ten million. How can you be a domineering CEO?

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.880
- Let's go. - Did I let you leave?

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.160
Come back!

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.760
Sit down.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.840
So we've passed...

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.520
this level, right?

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.240
Don't worry.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.640
I won't even look...

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.280
at someone like that.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.640
Wait for me then.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.840
What are you doing?

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.800
I'm going to the restroom.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.120
Why do you keep going to the restroom?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.880
I'm sorry.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.319
I've been talking to you since I woke up this morning.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.680
You haven't responded at all.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.600
Can you show me some respect?

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.080
Where are you going?

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.319
Answer me first. Who exactly was it?

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.760
Why did your heart suddenly flutter?

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.320
Chen Jia Wen.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
We've already broken up.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.240
It's none of your business anymore.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.560
That's right.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
It's none of my business.
