00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.820
Your Lordship.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.060
All right.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.179
You don't need to be afraid anymore.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.580
I've looked into it.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.740
The "tiger" and "big fish"

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.700
were just someone's prank.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.299
It scared us half to death just now.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.620
You two should head back

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.019
and get some rest.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.180
Yes, Your Lordship.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.099
Your Lordship.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.379
Why did Her Highness

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.820
pull such a strange prank?

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.100
It was scary.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.379
She's playful by nature.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.500
Perhaps she just wanted
to liven things up.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.740
Things have been rather solemn
in the palace.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.100
Don't overthink things.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.780
Just look after her.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.100
Understood.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.099
Liusu,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.299
you mentioned

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.779
that Lord Wing has had a strange illness
since childhood that causes him

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.219
to lose his sanity.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.580
What's the story behind that?

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.619
Your Highness,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.700
I'm not really sure either.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.379
Every time Lord Wing loses his sanity,

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.059
his personality changes drastically.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.740
It's as if he's a different person.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.459
When His Lordship was younger,

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.339
the late emperor

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.219
did have the Imperial Medical Court﻿
diagnose and treat him.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.420
The Imperial Medical Court
might know something.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.300
I see.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.100
Got it.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.060
But Your Highness﻿,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.980
His Majesty sent another servant today
asking if you have awakened.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.620
If you stay unconscious any longer,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.660
the people at the Imperial Medical Court
might be in trouble.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.659
Don't worry.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.100
I know what to do.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.859
Didn't you say the Empress﻿
would wake up today?

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.340
Why isn't she awake yet?

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.300
Your Majesty,

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.020
I've done everything I could.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.740
Everything you could?

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.180
All of you at the Imperial Medical Court﻿

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.900
and your clans
deserve the death penalty!

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.659
Execute him!

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.099
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.459
Mercy, Your Majesty! Mercy!

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.820
Your Majesty...

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.019
She's awake!

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.579
Her Highness has awakened!

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.539
Your Majesty...

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.660
Xin'er.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.980
Xin'er.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.580
You're finally awake.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.380
Do you feel any discomfort?

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.419
I feel much better.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.819
Her Highness is truly blessed

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.540
and fortunate.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.819
What use is the Imperial Medical Court?

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.219
You've made me worry so.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.859
Give him 50 beatings.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.459
Understood.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.460
Your Majesty.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.579
I owe my recovery

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.419
to Doctor Zhang's excellent skills

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.820
and proper treatment.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.300
Otherwise,

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.940
I might never have seen you again.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.699
He deserves to be rewarded.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.900
As you wish.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.939
Reward Doctor Zhang

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.140
with a thousand taels of gold.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.819
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.420
I thank Your Highness.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.339
Alas,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.060
I still feel weak all over.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.779
I'm afraid

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.260
I won't be able to serve you yet.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.619
Her Highness is right.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.619
Her body is extremely fragile now.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.099
She needs rest and careful nurturing.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.059
If her balance between yin and yang
is disturbed again,

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.980
her life could be at risk.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.579
Don't worry about anything.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.140
What matters is you're awake.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.419
We'll deal with everything else

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.620
another time.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.259
Your Majesty,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.500
I have some personal matters

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.060
and wish to consult Doctor Zhang.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.259
Very well.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.180
I will return
to attend to state affairs.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.139
I thank Your Highness for saving me.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.379
You don't need to thank me.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.700
Please rise.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.660
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.139
I have some questions.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.659
Ask away, Your Highness.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.979
Do you know

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.739
of an illness that causes a person
to frequently lose their mind

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.620
and undergo drastic personality changes?

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.100
What you're referring to

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.939
must be loss of soul disorder﻿.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.419
Loss of soul disorder?

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.379
Yes.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.739
When the patient has an episode,
they lose their mind and go berserk.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.219
But when they come to,

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.699
they don't remember anything
that happened during those times.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.660
It's like sleepwalking.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.260
Why does this happen?

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.139
There are many causes.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.139
Poisoning,

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.819
acupoint stimulation, and others.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.739
The symptoms vary

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.260
depending on the cause.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.659
There's an ancient text called

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.459
Secrets of the Meridian Pulse﻿

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.859
that explains it in detail.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.859
I shall bring it for Your Highness.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.819
Maybe you can find some answers there.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.579
All right.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.020
Thank you, Doctor Zhang.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.339
If the loss of sanity is caused
by poisoning,

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.620
the flesh will rot and stink.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.459
That's not it.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.499
If it's caused by acupoint stimulation,

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.220
the body will become rigid.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.980
It's not this either.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.220
The Child Gu resembles
glutinous rice in form.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.660
The Child Gu...

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.619
It confuses the mind

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.819
and causes loss of sanity.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.420
Patients' eyes glow red.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.780
It's a Gu.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.019
The caster uses
the Mother-Child Gu﻿ on a person.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.419
The patient loses their mind

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.980
and obeys all commands from the caster.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.979
If Xiling Xuan

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.060
was really infected by the Gu,

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.500
that means

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.539
he was controlled

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.980
when he killed my entire clan.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.580
The true culprit is someone else.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.340
(I must find out if Xiling Xuan
was really infected with the Gu.)

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.740
(He grew up with Xiling Heng.)

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.140
(Perhaps Xiling Heng knows something.)

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.860
Heng.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.060
Mother.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.460
You're back.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.140
Look what I brought you.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.820
Your Majesty.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.540
Isn't that

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.780
Father and Xuan's mother?

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.859
Mother! Mother!

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.539
Get down!

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.780
Mother! Mother!

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.259
Mother! Please get down!

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.859
You want her to get down from there?

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:24.619
I'll help you.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.940
Please.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.060
Demons

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.620
are never any good.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.220
All demons must die.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.060
I'll kill every last one of them!

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.460
Beast!

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.019
Wake up!

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.940
Get up!

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.060
Get up and get to work!
