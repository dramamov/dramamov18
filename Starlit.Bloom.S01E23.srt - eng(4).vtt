00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.460
(Mrs. Lin)

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.750
Hello, Mrs. Lin.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.520
It's you, Mo Li.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.110
Have you had fun abroad?

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.550
Thank you, Mo Li.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.080
Everything was well arranged!

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.190
My son has been thrilled.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.960
If you need anything, just let me know.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.830
Honey.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.800
Why...

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.550
Why are you abroad?

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.080
Be...

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.110
Be careful, okay?

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.520
Don't trust strangers so easily!

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.550
Mo Li has seen to everything,

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.390
so stop nagging. I'm hanging up.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.390
You are truly wicked

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.910
and stupid.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.240
I...

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.750
If you were a good lapdog,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.030
I'd make your life easier.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.600
But if you don't know
what's good for you...

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.110
So what if you've got the recording?

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.990
Are you going to report me
for running over Lu Jianhua?

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.390
I...

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.360
I was just joking.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.520
I've got nothing to lose anyway.

00:02:27.177 --> 00:02:29.150
You think I'd be scared
of you ratting me out?

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.390
Worst case, we both go down together.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.200
Just kidding.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.550
Mr. Lin.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.830
That's the fun part of the game.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.360
Is it fun?

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.110
No, it's not...

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.360
No?

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.110
I'm done.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.240
How about one more round?

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.360
No, I'm done...

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.480
Have one more drink.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.670
No thanks...

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.710
I need to use the washroom.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.040
Xiang.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.080
He's a lunatic.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.960
Send someone

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.590
to find my wife and kid.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.480
Don't worry, Xiang.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.760
As for the final move...

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.200
I want you

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.550
to figure out

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.670
his weak spot.

00:04:08.177 --> 00:04:10.110
(Since you've decided
to return to Xinghan,)

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.150
(bear this in mind.)

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.080
(You don't have to become
the perfect leader right away,)

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.990
(but you must let everyone know)

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.030
(that you returned to Xinghan)

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.560
(not because your last name is Lu.)

00:04:19.688 --> 00:04:21.680
(It's because you dare
to take responsibility)

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.120
(and face the storm head-on.)

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.790
If we pay them now,
they'll just ask for more!

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.200
What should we do, then?

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.030
Human greed has no bottom line.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.790
What matters more? Money or lives?

00:04:44.533 --> 00:04:46.466
Distribute the compensation funds
at once.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.910
Calm everyone down.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.470
(Demolition Compensation Agreement)
You make it sound so easy.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.470
You pay one family and the rest
will come and ask for it.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.520
We've followed
all the laws and regulations.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.710
Why should we compensate them?

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.470
Laws and regulations, huh?

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:05.710
If that's the case,

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.270
then how do you explain these photos?

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.390
Who took them?

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.710
Could someone
be trying to frame Xinghan?

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.440
Yeah.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.270
Who on earth took them?

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.640
Our priority now is

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.777
to minimize the impact
of these photos on Xinghan.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:37.710
Everyone.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.830
I call you all seniors

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.080
out of respect.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.590
But don't you forget

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.520
who's the largest shareholder
of Xinghan.

00:05:56.488 --> 00:05:58.622
Issue the compensation funds
immediately.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.880
Any objections to that?

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.830
Also,

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.390
establish an investigation team

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.760
and look into the demolition incident
thoroughly.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:13.520
And...

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.440
If

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.350
I find out

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.470
that any of you here
were involved in this,

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.030
I'll settle scores with you.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.640
Meeting adjourned.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.790
Mr. Xingchen
has no management experience.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.577
Judging from our financial report,

00:06:42.688 --> 00:06:44.320
his plan is not feasible.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.080
But he was very emotional just now.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.150
If we don't execute it,
he won't let it go.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.390
For the company's sake,

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.711
we'll have to do him wrong.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.200
But he has a point.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.222
We should come up
with a compensation plan

00:06:55.222 --> 00:06:57.111
to comfort the relocated residents.

00:06:57.133 --> 00:06:58.511
Where do we get the money for that?

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.880
The company's stock
has already dropped by 30%.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.910
If we pay them,
what about the new project?

00:07:04.444 --> 00:07:06.622
Mr. Mo has been
serving this company for years.

00:07:06.622 --> 00:07:08.466
(Xinghan Group)
So we should follow his lead.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.790
Ms. Gu, the PR plan
I made for Xinghan got rejected.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.200
I don't know the exact reason.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.760
Hello, is everything going smoothly?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.080
It's kind of strange. The execution
has been really slow.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.640
You just took the position.
The staff probably needs time to adjust.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.910
Yes.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.960
I'll make a feast for you and Baozhu
tomorrow after work.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.320
Sure. I'm heading
to the construction site.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.030
I miss you so much.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.470
(Me too.)

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:53.710
(By the way,
don't forget what I told you.)

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:55.440
(Yeah, I'll bear that in mind.)

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.320
Folks!

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.790
The heartless corporation is here!

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.390
(Illegal Demolition, Give Back Homes)
Guys, come out and shout the slogans!

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:01.960
Quick!

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.177
- We want our money back!
- We want our money back!

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.320
- We want our money back!
- We want our money back!

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.120
Surround them!

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.520
(Also, when one is influenced
by the behavior of a crowd,)

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.350
(it can affect their perception,
judgment, and awareness,)

00:08:15.377 --> 00:08:18.044
(Forced Demolition Is Against The Law)
(leading them to act like the majority.)

00:08:18.044 --> 00:08:20.080
(This is what's known
as herd mentality.)

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:23.830
Mo Li.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.080
You get out first.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.880
Alright.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.733
I'll go down first.

00:08:28.733 --> 00:08:29.320
Come out!

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:29.960
Heartless corporation!

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.680
- Get out of your car!
- Get out!

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.990
Heartless corporation!

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.280
Violent demolition!

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.160
Calm down.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.044
Heartless corporation!

00:08:37.044 --> 00:08:38.280
Everyone, calm down!

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.230
Violent demolition!

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:40.680
Give us back our homes!

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.510
This is not going to solve the problem.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.440
It's no use talking about that now.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:45.920
If you don't pay us today,

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.230
none of you are leaving!

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.040
Heartless corporation!

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.110
Everyone, calm down first.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.200
We're resolving the issue.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.160
Give us back our homes!

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.350
(If you want to break them down,)

00:08:58.510 --> 00:08:59.960
(you must avoid the leader)

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:01.990
(and find the weak one.)

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.320
I've found one.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.470
Sir, even though my dad is gone,

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.200
please believe me,
I won't let this project fail.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.630
If you push the Lu family into a corner,

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.590
you'll lose your money,

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:23.911
and no one will build your houses.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:24.830
Right?

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.280
What if we believe you now,

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:28.960
but you're just making empty promises?

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.280
You said “what if,” didn't you?

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.200
Alright.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.800
Let's say it's a “what if.”

00:09:33.288 --> 00:09:34.350
But if you really think

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.230
I'm just making false promises,

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.711
then I'll sign contracts

00:09:37.755 --> 00:09:39.800
with you
and all the villagers out there.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.230
I'll use my fixed assets
as collateral first.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.750
Sir, I just need
a little time right now.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.080
This really was an accident.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:49.960
On behalf of Xinghan,

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.350
I'd like to apologize again.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:52.630
I'm sorry.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.230
Then let me talk it over with my wife.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:56.200
Sure.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.320
Sure, sir.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.830
How about this?

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.710
Could you give me your contact?

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.350
Did I hear that right?

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.920
Mr. Lu from Xinghan
wants to add me on WeChat?

00:10:06.177 --> 00:10:08.400
I would only get
an assistant's number back then.

00:10:10.888 --> 00:10:12.230
We're all just ordinary people.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:13.510
I understand

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.160
losing your home must be hard.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:17.630
Please give me some time.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.920
I'm sorry.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.800
Oh, right.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.400

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.280
(Starry Sea Press Conference)
Let's welcome Starry Sea's designer,

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.400
Ms. Gu Liusu.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.470
Hello, everyone.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.590
I'm Gu Liusu, founder of GL.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.920
Our biggest innovation this time
is the material.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.960
Actually, we're not living
in an era of peace.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.560
In fact, ours is a peaceful country.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.440
At this very moment,
somewhere in the world,

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.350
someone might be suffering
because of war.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.280
Thus, we've taken shell casings
from war zones,

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.830
recycled and reused them.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.800
We reprocess the shell casings

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.320
and create NFTs from them,

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.680
recorded on the blockchain,

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.590
solving the issue of easy duplication
and unclear copyright.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.920
Buyers can also own unique collectibles.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.160
Ms. Gu, GL used to work with diamonds.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.440
What made you
change materials this time?

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.560
Mr. Xingchen,
here's Group Five's performance report.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.510
Please take a look.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.440
Is that the group that often
complains about slow approvals?

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.280
Well...

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.200
Alright, we'll grant
those capable colleagues more authority.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.230
Understood.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.590
I've reviewed the report.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:49.160
Your team's performance
grew by 70% compared to last year.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.590
But I've also heard complaints

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.800
that too many approval layers
slow things down,

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.680
causing some projects
to fail mid-process.

00:12:01.222 --> 00:12:02.500
In the second half of the year,

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.400
I'll grant you a privilege.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.800
For deals under five million,

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:07.870
your team can approve them internally.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:11.630
For those who try to copy our work,

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.680
you can imitate the look of our pieces,

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.960
but you can't replicate
the sound of metal crying.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.080
More importantly,

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.080
our work carries weight.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.230
It's not just physical weight.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.710
But there's also the weight
of our hope for peace and love.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:30.800
You all

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:31.920
deserve it!

00:12:32.444 --> 00:12:34.844
- Thank you, Mr. Xingchen!
- Thank you, Mr. Xingchen!

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.440
Mr. Xingchen seems like
a whole new person.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.133
Don't call him Mr. Xingchen.
It's Mr. Lu.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.440
(It's about time
to head home for dinner.)

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.440
Hello, Baozhu.

00:12:45.066 --> 00:12:47.320
I'm coming to pick you up
for dinner at my place.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.710
You go ahead.
I don't feel like going out.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.400
I've seen to it all.
Keep GL's operating funds.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.560
The rest will be transferred
to Xinghan's account.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.750
I won't allow you to drown in sadness.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.400
Wait for me. I'm coming now.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.080
Sure.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:29.620
(Nurse Station)

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.200
Pardon me.
