WEBVTT

00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.240
(Mingang Distribution)

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.410
It's unanimous.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.780
Very well. By unanimous decision,

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.850
Acting Chairman Min Kyung Chae...

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.520
is hereby appointed...

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.750
as the next chairman.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.730
Not so fast!

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.560
Who says she's chairman?

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.300
Father, how did you get here?

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.550
They should have reached a decision
by now.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.820
Unless something unexpected happened,
it must've passed, right?

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.490
So, what's going to happen to me then?

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.590
Once Kyung Chae officially becomes
Mingang Distribution's second chairman?

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.030
What do I do?

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.690
Darn it.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.230
What are you muttering to yourself about?

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.560
You're curious too, aren't you?

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.330
Did it pass or fail?

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.640
If you're so curious, go find out.
Stop pacing around out here.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.180
And to think,
you were the child I trusted most.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.320
The best things
I've done in my life were...

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.450
founding Mingang Distribution...

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.920
and having you as my daughter.
That was it.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.620
Father.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.090
I hope you learn what it feels like
to be betrayed by your most trusted child.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.830
One day, I hope your own child
kidnaps you and locks you up,

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.630
so you know how it feels,
you ungrateful brat!

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.440
Father, I'm sorry.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.070
(Mingang Distribution)

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.680
I never meant for this to happen.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.780
Things just got complicated.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.090
Get out now!

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.790
Get out of my company and out of my house.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.160
I never want to see your face again!

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.960
As of today, you're no longer my daughter.
I'm disowning you.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.170
I'm sorry, Father.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.970
Please, forgive me just this once.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.770
Please, I'm begging you. Just this once.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.340
If anyone lets this thing set foot
in this company again,

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.580
they'll be thrown out right alongside her.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.650
What are you still doing here?
I said, "Get out!"

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.820
Don't pack a thing. Get out right now.
From the company and from my house.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.150
I can't stand to look at a monster
like you anymore.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.320
You're disgusting, and you make me sick.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.960
No matter how badly you want my position,
this is unforgivable.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.600
After that the nursing home incident,
I knew your true nature,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.030
but I still gave you a chance,
thinking you might change.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.500
But I was wrong.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.200
That old saying,
"A leopard can't change its spots,"

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.440
is 100 percent true.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.540
You're a hopeless, irredeemable case.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.010
You're a pathetic soul who doesn't repent,

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.480
even when given the chance.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.380
That's exactly who you are.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.920
What are you waiting for? Get out!

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.440
Let's go home.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.090
Goodness. Wake up, Kyung Chae.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.520
Wait. She's breathing.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.430
What's wrong with her?

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.160
She must have fainted from the shock.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.260
Frankly, I'd have fainted too.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.870
He looked like the Grim Reaper,
not like Dad.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.070
Hey, Kyung Chae! Wake up!

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.470
Kyung Chae! Can you hear me? Kyung Chae!

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.040
I'll take her to the doctor or a hospital,

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.840
so you two can go.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.380
Hey, what just happened?

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.950
How did Dad get here?

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.380
Where has he been all this time?

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.120
So the motion to appoint her chairman
failed, right?

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.890
Hey, is that all you care about right now?

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.220
We don't even know where he's...

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.920
Right. Kyung Chae.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.330
Hey, Kyung Chae. Wake up. Kyung Chae.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.130
I told you I'd handle it!

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.400
We want to help. What's your problem?

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.630
Let's just go.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.040
Hold on.
Hey, you'd better take good care of her.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.210
You hear me? Got it?
I said take good care of her, you punk!

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.780
You can get up now.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.820
No one's here. I said, "Get up."

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.840
How could you mess up so badly
that my father got here?

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.670
Do you still think...

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.110
I will marry you after this?

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.140
You always mess up when it matters most.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.980
This is as good as you get!

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.850
That's enough!
I'm at my breaking point here, too.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.790
My life has never
been this royally messed up before.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.660
You think this is bad for you?
It's a nightmare for me!

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.290
We were so close, so it's killing me
to watch everything crumble now.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.130
I hope you didn't forget that the deal was
to make me chairman for you to marry me.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.930
Now that the plan's ruined,

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.740
we should call off
this brilliant engagement.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.110
You're being hasty.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.280
If you turn your back on me, it's over.
Don't you get it?

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.280
Who else do you have in your corner?

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.050
You saw for yourself earlier.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.360
Those board members who cowered
at the sound of the chairman's voice...

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.320
all ran off to save their own necks.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.660
You'll lose your home, not just the firm.
And you want to call things off with me?

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.900
Then I have no reason to stick around.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.870
You only get one chance.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.640
There won't be another.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.490
If we're going to do this,
we have to do it right.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.730
Get on my back.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.880
Someone's collapsed!

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.350
Someone call an ambulance!

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.990
Welcome back, Chairman.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.660
Where on earth have you been?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.970
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.010
- Please get a hot towel ready.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.620
My head is splitting from all the stress.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:01.320
I'm sure it is. You look terribly pale.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.090
You haven't been eating properly,
have you?

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.890
You were so brave to endure all that.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.560
It's incredible that you held on.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.700
It was no different than a POW camp.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.430
Those punks held me hostage
and kept threatening me.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.670
I couldn't get a proper night's sleep.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.740
Ever since you went missing,
I haven't had a peaceful night's sleep.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.580
But you can rest easy now.
I'm here by your side.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:50.030
Don't let anyone in without my permission.
The chairman needs his rest.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.640
Yes, ma'am.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.410
I haven't had a nap like that in ages.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.280
Is someone here?

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.250
I thought I heard a sound.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.020
The chairman has returned.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.650
- What? You mean Father?
- Dad's here?

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.060
Maybe you should see him later.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.590
He needs to rest right now.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.500
So where on earth was he?
Was he staying at a hotel?

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.760
Or was he abroad somewhere?

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.930
How does he just appear out of the blue?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.240
Tell me about it.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.240
Then why the sigh?

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.680
Wait a minute, Manager Gong.
Don't tell me you're not happy he's back.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.950
Of course not. What a thing to say.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.110
You're really something else.

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.490
I've made sure the doctor and nurses
will keep their mouths shut.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.130
So, from now on,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.270
I have a concussion
from when I collapsed in the boardroom...

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.230
and got amnesia as a result.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.470
But do you have to go this far?

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.570
He said he was throwing me out.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.610
It's not just the company anymore.
He's kicking me out of the house.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.210
He's even threatening to disown me.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.710
Surely, if I had amnesia,

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.320
he wouldn't disown his own daughter
who doesn't remember anything.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.850
First, I need to buy us some time this way
and figure out my next move.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.460
That Lucia and Moon Tae Kyung!

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.360
How am I supposed
to get those two out of my life!

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.960
Why do they have to undermine me
at every turn?

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.370
- Yes? What is it?
- What do you mean, "what is it?"

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.870
How's Kyung Chae?

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.040
I heard you ran out carrying her.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.640
She's in a private room
at Uijeong Hospital.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.610
So she was actually admitted?

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.110
Is it serious?

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.320
If you're so curious,
come see for yourself.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.590
Ji Seop will be here any minute.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.290
We need him to see this and run back
to the family with the news.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:56.660
Hand me that.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:29.290
Hey, Kyung Chae.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:31.830
What?

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.330
What's with you?

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.270
Why do you have a flower in your hair?

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:39.570
What's wrong with her?

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.170
She got a concussion
when she collapsed earlier.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.940
It didn't look like she fell that hard.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.680
So what's the diagnosis?
Does she need brain surgery?

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.380
She doesn't need surgery,

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.080
and everything else is fine,

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.050
but there are some lingering side effects
from the concussion.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:56.750
What kind of side effects?

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:02.530
Excuse me, who are you?

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.200
What?

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.700
Do I know you?

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.900
- I don't think we've met.
- Hey,

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.970
what's gotten into you?

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.510
It's me. Your older brother.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.210
Gosh, that flower.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.410
Older brother? What's that?

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:26.520
Is it like hand-pulled dough soup
or something?

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.860
Now that I mention it,
I'm suddenly craving a bowl.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:32.620
- Mister!
- Hey...

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.160
Can you buy me a bowl
of hand-pulled dough soup?

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:38.430
Wait, hang on.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.570
It's dissociative amnesia,
caused by the shock.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:45.800
Amnesia?

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.710
Kyung Chae, he's your older brother.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.180
My brother?

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.110
I don't remember you,

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:58.550
but I'm so happy to have a brother.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:03.320
I bet we were really close siblings.
Right?

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.860
Well, not exactly.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.330
You always picked on me
and treated me like dirt.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:11.100
I did?

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.430
There's no way.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.270
But if I did...

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.270
Please forgive me...

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.840
for not recognizing
you were my wonderful brother.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.880
I'm such a horrible sister.

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.510
I deserve to die!

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.420
Hey... What is this...

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.750
She's completely lost it.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.490
The one and only Min Kyung Chae
is kneeling before me.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.080
Let me make one thing perfectly clear.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:03.380
As of today, no one enters his room
without my permission.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.780
If you need something,
you come to me first.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.420
Aren't you going too far?

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.690
Are you trying to keep us away
from our own dad?

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:11.920
That's the idea.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.160
Who do you think is to blame
for him being like this?

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:15.660
The chairman...

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:18.630
was kidnapped and held captive
all this time.

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:26.040
Who would do such a thing to our dad?

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:28.710
Kyung Chae.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.440
That's ridiculous.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:33.310
Why would she do that?

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.880
You knew she was the acting chairman,
right?

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:41.650
It seems she used the chairman's absence
to officially take over the chairmanship.

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:43.820
An emergency board meeting was called
for that reason.

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:46.920
Any later, and her motion would've passed.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.290
I found the chairman and brought him back
before it passed.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.430
The chairman is furious.

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:56.570
He's removing Kyung Chae from everything,

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:57.640
both the house and the company.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.170
And anyone who dares to defy him
will join her.

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:06.780
You and Director Moon were the ones
to rescue our dad again.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.350
I find that a little strange.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.410
It's just like last time.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.590
There's nothing strange about it.
Someone has to, since his children won't.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:19.090
What were all of you doing while we,
who aren't family, had to act?

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.130
That's because Kyung Chae said
she was handling it.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:22.930
Since when did you trust her so much?

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.700
That doesn't give you the right
to keep us from seeing our father!

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:29.530
I don't need your permission.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.970
My word is the chairman's command.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.170
The second you open that door,

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:37.840
you'll be thrown out
right alongside your sister.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:49.750
You won't believe what I just saw.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.790
What is it?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.960
No, I saw something
even scarier than a ghost.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:56.660
Kyung Chae!

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.360
She was wearing a flower in her hair!

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:02.430
What? Kyung Chae had what in her hair?

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:04.440
A flower! I'm telling you!

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.770
Let me see.
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.280
I'm fine. I stopped by a pharmacy earlier.

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:15.910
You think a pharmacy is enough for that?

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.680
You're really going through a lot,
Tae Kyung.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:20.520
Not at all.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.650
You're the one secretly working hard.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.060
How could your mother bear to pass away?

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.330
- Leaving behind such a wonderful son.
- Goodness.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.300
We've stopped the board meeting,
so that's settled.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.070
And from what I saw, it looks like
the directors are back on our side.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.570
Does that mean the real battle
for stakes starts now?

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:42.510
On that note,

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.780
I think we need to pick up the pace.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.910
I need you to really rattle Oh Pan Sool.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.020
Why do you keep spying on
Tae Kyung's room?

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.830
Spying? I'm watching him openly.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.760
Does he have a lot of work?
What's keeping him so late?

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.600
He should be out with his girlfriend
after getting off work.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.970
Why would he...

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:11.640
run straight home
the second the whistle blows?

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:15.940
You'll catch flies with your mouth open.
If you're tired, just go to bed,

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.540
and stop chirping in my ear.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.980
Here he comes.

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.580
- I'm home.
- I've been waiting. What took so long?

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.720
What happened to your face?

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.920
My goodness, and your hand too?

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:30.690
It's nothing.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.920
But were you waiting for me?

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:37.060
He wasn't just waiting?
Romeo had nothing on him.

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.700
Hey, that lover would've
had nothing on me!

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:43.930
After dinner, he turned into a statue,
waiting for you.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.440
What did you need to see me about?

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.180
I wanted to ask you something.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:58.980
How are things at the company these days?
Is everything running smoothly?

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:00.920
Why do you ask all of a sudden?

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.760
As you know,
I own a lot of Mingang Distribution stock.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.830
But it's just not showing
any signs of going up.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:09.860
That's just how the stock market
is these days.

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.930
- The industry is full of competitors.
- Tell me about it.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.600
Mingang Distribution
used to have no rivals.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.700
It's not like that anymore, is it?

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.670
So are you thinking of selling your
Mingang Distribution stock?

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:23.310
I'm thinking about it.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:27.640
My son-in-law tells me to hold on to it,
but what's the point if there's no payoff?

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.850
That's true.
The thrill of stocks is seeing them rise.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:31.920
Exactly.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:35.090
So I've got a lot on my mind lately.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:41.290
Amnesia?

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:44.260
Apparently, Vice Director Min confirmed it
after visiting her at the hospital.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:48.800
They say her collapse injured her brain,
but I don't know if I should believe it.

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:51.640
So, of all the possible side effects,
she just happens to get that?

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.210
Her antics have gone from cute to cruel.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.840
She's probably just faking memory loss
to buy herself some time.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.880
Let's go check on her together after work.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.350
Let's make it tomorrow.
I have somewhere to be after work today.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.520
Don't tell me I came
while you were swamped.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.690
Of course not. This is my downtime.

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:14.090
But what was all that talk from earlier?

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:16.790
So the chairman's eldest daughter
kidnapped Chairman Min?

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:20.100
- You heard me right.
- My gosh.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.130
That's front-page news. Seriously.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.540
How could a daughter do that to her dad?

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.370
That's terrifying.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.540
Gosh, are all rich people like that?

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.480
I doubt all rich people are like that.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.880
It's just that family.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:39.920
You've got a point.
That family was never exactly normal.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:44.050
You must be having a very tough time.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.260
Hardly.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.060
- So, about that thing I asked for?
- Right.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.360
(Chunbokjib Black Goat)

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:53.330
Here you go.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.670
It's black goat extract made at my shop.
This stuff is the real deal.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.580
Where were you earlier?

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.550
The secretary said
you were out of the office.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:11.720
I went out to buy this for you.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.450
A close friend of mine makes it
at her shop.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:21.020
It's a black goat extract that's supposed
to be really good for health.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:25.530
Here, try some.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.430
You're the only one who looks out for me.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.040
Gosh, this is potent.

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.140
Hey, don't just sit there.
You have one too.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.280
You must have been exhausted
looking for me day and night.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.620
I think I'm already
feeling more energetic.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.860
Chairman, please don't go anywhere again.
You have to stay right here with me, okay?

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.260
Of course.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.300
But I heard Kyung Chae...

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.340
is in the hospital right now.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.410
Why?

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.040
Come to think of it.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.810
I told you to kick her out immediately.
Don't tell me you haven't done it yet.

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:14.610
There was no time for that.

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:16.480
When she collapsed at the meeting,

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.580
I believe Lawyer Kim took her
to the hospital.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.920
They say she has amnesia
due to complications from a concussion.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:25.520
What?

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.230
What's the mood like at the house?

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.400
Has Father calmed down at all?

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:32.800
Who knows?

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:34.800
He hasn't come out of his room at all.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:37.300
Then you should go in and check on him.

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:38.800
As if I could.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.100
That woman says no one is allowed...

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.340
to enter the chairman's room
without her permission.

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.480
That's ridiculous.
Who does she think she is?

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.850
She's acting all high and mighty
just because she saved the chairman.

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:52.020
Is Father really falling
for that vixen's act again?

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:54.850
He relies on her more than ever.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:57.820
At this point, he'd probably jump
off a bridge if she asked him to.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.230
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.870
Come on. That's just wrong.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.270
What? What did I do?

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:20.810
You should have at least told me
about how you rescued my father.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.710
Look, it was a rescue operation.

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:24.650
It's a long story.
You want the whole thing now?

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:28.020
Trust me,
I can't even tell that story sober.

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:31.460
Do you have any idea how hard I worked
to find out where the chairman was?

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.460
Right. When you found out,
you should have told me, his son!

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:38.200
It's a little late to be playing
the concerned son, don't you think?

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.730
The chairman wasn't missing
for just a day or two.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.000
I bet the stock price was just an excuse.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.570
You didn't want to find him, did you?

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.540
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:51.170
So what? Are you calling me a bad son now?

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:56.210
It's not like I didn't want to find him.
The circumstances made it impossible.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.550
Hey, you said it was urgent last time.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.420
I'm taking time off from the office.

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:04.450
Why?

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.420
You really have to ask?
Someone needs to be at the hospital.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.560
Right. Kyung Chae.
So, is she still in that state?

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.160
- Is she completely out of it?
- Don't worry.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:15.900
She'll be back to her old self.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.070
We're not going down like this.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.080
Hello?

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:40.290
Looks like Lawyer Kim Sun Jae
will be out of the office for a while.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.160
Really?

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:45.700
Then I'm sure those two are plotting
something together.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:47.230
Let's go check on them later.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:53.170
Right now?

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:55.910
Got it.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:00.480
I just heard Lucia and Moon Tae Kyung
are here at the nurses' station.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.850
They're here to see how I'm doing.

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.350
Goes to show that you can't trust anyone.

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:19.030
No way! Looks like you hit your head
harder than I thought.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.070
I heard it was a concussion.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.770
That's right, a concussion.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.170
If you don't believe me,
you can go talk to her doctor.

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:30.070
Or should I call in
her attending nurse for you?

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.080
Do you recognize me?

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:36.850
Who?

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:38.950
Do you know me?

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.550
Of course. I know you very well.

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:44.090
You do?

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:45.660
That's great.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.920
I've been dying to know who I am.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.890
Do you happen to know my family too?

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.200
Then what about my father?

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:59.240
I can't remember his face
or even his name,

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.240
but I want to know how he is
and miss him so much.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:05.110
I didn't do anything to make
my father angry, did I?

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.780
I really hope not.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:12.280
Because that would just break my heart.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.490
I miss my father so much.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.520
Wherever he is, I just hope he lives
a long, healthy life.

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.000
Just thinking about my father
brings tears to my eyes.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:36.340
I'm going to pray for my father.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.680
Dear deity.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:43.610
Wherever my father may be,

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:47.050
please grant him a healthy
and peaceful life.

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.120
I pray with all my heart.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.890
Let's go.
We don't want to disturb her prayer.

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:54.860
Yes, let's go.

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:57.290
May his life be filled with hope,

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:03.030
and may he be filled with love
until his final breath.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.440
Darn it!

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.580
You were great.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.250
The point is, they think you've lost it.

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:24.990
All that matters is that the chairman
hears about this, right?

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.990
You did a great job.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.260
(Mingang Distribution)

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:00.260
What are you doing here?
I told you to rest at home.

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:03.260
I have something to take care of.
I'll head back when I'm done.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:06.500
Is it that urgent?
Does it have to be done today?

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.160
Every second counts.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:10.300
What in the world is it?

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:12.940
I'm here to repay a debt I owe you.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.010
A debt?

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.320
Shall I proceed with the revision
to the will, as you instructed?

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:34.260
Yes, you must.
Regarding the clause on my unavailability,

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.390
delete the clause naming Min Kyung Chae
as acting chairman.

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:40.560
Very well. Are there any other changes
you'd like to make?

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.670
No. That's all.

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.570
Then you just need to name her replacement
as acting chairman.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.570
She's right here.

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.910
Replace Min Kyung Chae with Jung Lucia.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:10.030
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:26.740
What do you mean?
The chairman's will was amended?

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:28.240
Kyung Chae, what's wrong?

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:31.780
I think Kyung Chae has lost her mind,
not amnesia.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:34.950
Be my son.
From now on, we're father and son.

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.390
Bring me the ledgers.
I've found someone to take over the books.

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.290
Putting the fox in charge of the henhouse?

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.060
Who are you people?

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:43.990
Come with us quietly, Mr. Lawyer.

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:45.460
Did the chairman send you?

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:51.270
