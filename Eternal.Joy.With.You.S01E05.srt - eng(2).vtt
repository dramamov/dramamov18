00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.880
Marquis, what's so urgent

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.150
for you to come so late?

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.320
Nothing much.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.390
I just saw a shadow

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.750
flicker past in the courtyard.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.840
It might be a thief,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.070
and I followed it here.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.710
Did you see anyone pass by?

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.510
A thief?

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.040
I saw no such person.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.000
It's good that he's not here.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.950
But for your safety,

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.000
it's better to check carefully.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.950
Marquis, are you suspecting

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.280
the thief might be hiding in my bed?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.040
Why so nervous?

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.230
One look will tell.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.870
Are you relieved now, Marquis?

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.230
I need to rest now.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.540
Perhaps you should go check elsewhere.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.320
Hmph.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.280
Thank you for your help.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.310
No need for thanks.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.360
I'm just curious.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.840
Lady Xu, it's so late.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.080
Where have you been?

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.960
I'm afraid that's none of your concern.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.560
You really know how to cut ties.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.590
I just helped you,

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.960
and now it's none of my concern?

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.710
Well,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.310
Cui Yunfeng hasn't gone far yet, has he?

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.120
Are you threatening me?

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.240
That's right.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.840
Then I have a question for you, too.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.000
Since you are no Master Physician,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.310
Ping's face wasn't treated by you, was it?

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.240
Lady Xu truly is clever.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.560
But since you know my true identity,

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.310
you should understand

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.000
that I can find
the real Master Physician to help.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.590
I can tell you what happened tonight,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.240
however,

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.590
I'll need your help in return.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.280
What's the matter?

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.520
Is Wanning not in there?

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.360
Marquis, Madam has gone to rest.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.240
It's best not to disturb her.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.120
I need to talk to her. It's urgent.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.190
Marquis, please come tomorrow.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.430
These days,

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.750
she's exhausted from household affairs.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.430
Exhausted?

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.910
In that case, I must see her.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.640
Yunfeng?

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.030
You... Why are you here?

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.800
What kind of question is that?

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.150
If I'm not here, where else could I be?

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.840
I heard you had something urgent to discuss.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.200
It's nothing.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.750
Get some rest if you're feeling unwell.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.100
I'll check on you later.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.080
All right.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.710
My Lady,

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.030
how did you come back?

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.310
I flew back.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.270
I brought you back.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.390
Can you tell me now?

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.870
It's a prescription
for women's private ailments.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.120
I went out tonight

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.680
to find the person who wrote it.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.680
I want no one to know

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.040
about my private ailments.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.240
But if Commander Pei wants to know,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.950
I'll explain it to you in detail.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.630
That better be the case.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.920
Thank you, Commander.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.270
Which way?

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.360
My Lady, the midwife lives here.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.520
Madam.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.240
Here you are.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.920
Why are you here?

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.390
I also want to see

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.270
what kind of midwife

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.240
treats women's private ailments.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.920
Such a big cup for tea.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.720
I had my reasons yesterday.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.050
I wasn't trying to hide anything.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.800
So you plan to talk now?

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.360
Granny Li,

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.390
six years ago you delivered my baby.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.510
What happened after the child was born?

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:06.920
You don't want to say?

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.560
If you don't tell the truth,

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.120
the Commander of Jinlin Guards here

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.800
has ways to make you wish for death.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.760
Speak quickly.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.070
I'll talk.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.870
After the child was born,

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.830
Marquis Cui and Lady Cui

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.720
took the child away.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.070
Later,

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.920
they brought the child back again.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.720
Did something happen?

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.480
When I delivered the baby,

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.680
there was a heart-shaped birthmark

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.310
on the child's shoulder,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.390
but the one they returned had none.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.430
At that time,

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.800
I didn't want to cause trouble

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.160
so I dared not question it.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.870
Do you know where they took my child?

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.200
I don't know.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.560
I only heard by chance from Marquis Cui.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.880
He said…

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.720
they threw it away.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.430
All right, I see.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.070
If you remember anything else, tell me.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:22.830
I will.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.480
It's about to snow.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.070
That child

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.430
died in the first snow six years ago.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.390
(I must find my child as soon as possible.)

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.830
Raise the sedan!

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.750
You plotted your way from the capital

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.120
into this marriage years ago.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.920
Is this the life

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:30.070
you wanted?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.670
Did you pry into others'
private matters back then, too?

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.720
It caused quite a stir.

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:40.830
Everyone knew about it.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.200
So do you know what I'm doing now?

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.200
Do whatever you want in the Cui Family.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.720
I only care about what I'm investigating.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.600
You mean the Hongzhen Incense?

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.870
Indeed.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.150
I told you I know nothing about it.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.960
Instead of wasting time on me,

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.740
you should investigate others in the mansion.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.720
Who put the Hongzhen Incense in Ping's room?

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:06.880
Have you figured it out?

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.030
You should put your mind to it,

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.150
Commander Pei.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.550
My Lady, you're so clever.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.910
This path is rarely used.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.840
No one will see us leave.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:27.520
All right, Ping.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.480
You must be tired.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.840
Come, drink something.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:36.920
Look at you.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.960
You've spoiled Ping so much lately.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.510
He's my child.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:41.910
Of course I'll dote on him.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.320
That wretch Xu Wanning

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.240
does nothing but criticize Ping all day.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:46.750
What gives her the right?

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:47.960
Isn't that right, Ping?

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.800
Yes.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:50.750
Speaking of her,

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.480
I don't know
what's gotten into that woman lately.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.480
That night I saw her leave her room,

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.550
yet moments later, she was back inside.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.270
Up to no good, surely.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.670
Marquis, don't mention that wretch now.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.080
It's such a buzzkill.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.590
All right.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:07.750
Don't get so close.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.260
We shouldn't be seen together.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.510
Also, be mindful of how you speak.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.200
Why so cautious?

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.910
I am Ping's mother after all.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.630
Yes, that's right.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.390
If my mother hears you say that,

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.270
she won't let you off.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:22.870
Marquis,

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.720
to see my own child

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.030
call another woman "mother"...

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.630
You wouldn't understand that torment.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:31.330
I don't know when days like this

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.150
will come to an end.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.080
At least you can see him every day now.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.320
I'll manage to get rid of Xu Wanning later.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.200
All right.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.870
Then I shall wait.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:43.840
Come, Ping.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.630
Father, Mother.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.670
Since she is so eager to be Ping's mother,

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.270
I should help her get her wish sooner.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.200
Come here, all of you.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.320
Have you heard?

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.930
That newly arrived Miss Bai said

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:03.460
she's the young master's real mother.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.580
No wonder she treats him so tenderly.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.240
Come to think of it, they do look alike.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.360
Could it be true?

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.930
I saw her flirting with the Marquis.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:11.730
Could it be true?

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.360
Could he truly be an illegitimate child?

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.000
Ugh, how shameless.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.150
Is she really Ping's mother?

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.040
Hongmei.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.040
You did well.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.200
Let these rumors spread even more.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.160
Understood.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.910
I've told you to be more careful,

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.260
but you just wouldn't listen.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.440
If these filthy rumors

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.790
spread beyond the residence,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.030
our family will

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:39.390
be the laughingstock of Yan City.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:40.750
Lady Cui,

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.120
I know I was wrong.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.960
I'll never say I'm Ping's mother again.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.790
From today on,

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.550
you will not see Ping again.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.200
You know the consequences if you do.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:52.920
Feng,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.030
you should also stop meeting her.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:57.790
I'll do as you say.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.960
As for anyone caught gossiping again,

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:02.600
they will be severely punished.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.160
No need.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.150
Rumors will dissipate.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.750
Right now, the selection for First-Rank Lady
is approaching.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.840
We can't afford any scandal.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.960
Mother is right.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.200
Lady Cui.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:19.540
Something terrible has happened.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.550
Madam is punishing the young master.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.440
What?

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.980
(Blessing Treasure)

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.280
Ping.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.390
Father. Grandmother.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.840
My hand hurts from writing.

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.240
Wanning, what's this about?

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.440
Wanning, did Ping do something wrong?

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.910
Today, his teacher

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:48.480
said Ping's calligraphy was poor.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.960
He then insulted the teacher.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.120
I scolded him

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.910
and meant to teach him myself,

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.440
but he shouted that I wasn't his mother.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.510
After ten months of carrying you,

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.440
this is how you repay me?

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.120
As his mother, I must discipline him.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.360
She is not my mother.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.030
Mother, that bad woman is so mean.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:24.870
