The person who killed Eom Sun-jeong…

00:00:50.572 --> 00:00:51.906
is me.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.032
What?

00:00:53.116 --> 00:00:55.368
-What's she saying?
-Hey, go to her! Hurry!

00:01:00.248 --> 00:01:02.125
Neither President-elect nor Ms. Cha

00:01:03.793 --> 00:01:05.503
are involved in the case.

00:01:05.587 --> 00:01:07.005
Do you have evidence?

00:01:07.088 --> 00:01:08.256
To support your claim?

00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:12.385
I handed over the dashcam footage
showing the accident

00:01:13.553 --> 00:01:15.096
to the police.

00:01:22.187 --> 00:01:23.188
We don't have time.

00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:25.815
I'm not talking about your time.

00:01:27.525 --> 00:01:29.485
I'm talking about the time I have left.

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.362
This should be my job.

00:01:32.572 --> 00:01:34.282
Let me handle it one last time.

00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:40.788
Excuse me.

00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:48.963
Let's go.

00:01:52.258 --> 00:01:53.593
Wait a minute.

00:01:53.676 --> 00:01:55.303
Is there any other evidence?

00:01:55.386 --> 00:01:57.138
Are you covering for Mr. Hyun?

00:01:57.222 --> 00:01:59.724
Did he instigate you
to murder Eom Sun-jeong?

00:01:59.807 --> 00:02:01.559
Was it a planned murder?

00:02:01.643 --> 00:02:02.894
Did you really kill her?

00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:07.565
Say something!

00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:30.046
Mom, why didn't you wake me up?

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.232
TO GANG-MYEONG

00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:09.794
QUESTION: DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE ACCIDENT SCENE

00:03:15.091 --> 00:03:18.553
It was February,
with the election around the corner.

00:03:20.388 --> 00:03:21.597
President-elect…

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.852
No, he was still a candidate then.

00:03:29.063 --> 00:03:30.356
Candidate Hyun

00:03:31.566 --> 00:03:34.777
was looking for Eom Sun-jeong,
and I found out about it.

00:03:36.571 --> 00:03:37.572
Eom Sun-jeong.

00:03:38.156 --> 00:03:39.449
She was born in 1982.

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:42.660
I worked with her
in Haseong Petrochemical.

00:03:42.744 --> 00:03:44.370
Get her contact information.

00:03:45.163 --> 00:03:47.498
Keep it from Secretary Shin and the rest.

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:49.959
I must check something with her.

00:03:51.336 --> 00:03:53.129
I thought I should be in the know

00:03:53.212 --> 00:03:56.299
about everything
that concerned Candidate Hyun.

00:03:56.841 --> 00:03:59.052
Even the smallest mistake

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:02.513
could ruin the election.

00:04:04.265 --> 00:04:05.350
So,

00:04:07.268 --> 00:04:10.355
I decided to use the method Ms. Cha used.

00:04:11.314 --> 00:04:13.066
Tell me in detail.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.076
You're saying you bugged him?

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.912
With this device your lawyer submitted.

00:04:29.957 --> 00:04:30.917
Yes.

00:04:32.251 --> 00:04:33.336
That's right.

00:04:34.587 --> 00:04:37.048
I bugged him using this device.

00:04:38.216 --> 00:04:41.886
Why did you bug him just because
he was looking for Eom Sun-jeong?

00:04:43.388 --> 00:04:46.641
Because I knew they used to be lovers.

00:04:46.724 --> 00:04:49.310
You knew they were once lovers,

00:04:49.394 --> 00:04:51.354
so you went so far as to bug him.

00:04:52.605 --> 00:04:54.107
In case it could cause a problem.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.405
To prove my concern right, on February 26,

00:05:02.907 --> 00:05:05.368
Candidate Hyun suddenly disappeared.

00:05:07.412 --> 00:05:10.289
FEBRUARY 26, 2027

00:05:19.924 --> 00:05:21.175
HASEONG COASTAL ROAD

00:05:21.926 --> 00:05:24.804
It was a very foggy day.

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.440
I was chasing after Candidate Hyun,

00:05:36.732 --> 00:05:38.276
but I ended up driving past him.

00:07:19.252 --> 00:07:21.462
MS. CHA

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.155
This is your call history from that day.

00:07:49.365 --> 00:07:52.785
At the exact time of the accident,
Cha Su-yeon called you.

00:07:52.868 --> 00:07:54.287
But you didn't pick it up.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.788
Five minutes later,

00:07:55.871 --> 00:07:58.457
she called you again,
and you answered it then.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.209
What did you talk about?

00:08:01.168 --> 00:08:02.920
Did you conspire with her

00:08:03.004 --> 00:08:04.088
to kill Ms. Eom?

00:08:04.797 --> 00:08:06.465
Did you guys discuss the murder?

00:08:07.842 --> 00:08:09.135
No.

00:08:10.219 --> 00:08:12.054
Ms. Cha has nothing to do with this.

00:08:19.353 --> 00:08:21.981
What happened to my husband? Where is he?

00:08:22.064 --> 00:08:23.149
I apologize.

00:08:23.691 --> 00:08:25.151
I still can't find him.

00:08:25.234 --> 00:08:27.653
You can't find him? How is that possible?

00:08:28.613 --> 00:08:31.198
I'll call you back when I do.

00:08:58.476 --> 00:09:01.354
Why did you leave the scene
without reporting it?

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.484
If it wasn't a planned murder,

00:09:07.526 --> 00:09:08.694
why didn't you report it?

00:09:09.445 --> 00:09:12.782
If you didn't conspire it with Ms. Cha,
why did you run away?

00:09:24.543 --> 00:09:26.462
Ms. Shin Hae-rin, answer.

00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:28.964
You fled from the scene. Why?

00:09:29.048 --> 00:09:29.882
Hold on.

00:09:32.593 --> 00:09:34.929
If it's too much, shall we take a break?

00:09:50.528 --> 00:09:52.154
I was afraid.

00:09:52.738 --> 00:09:54.657
Afraid you'd be punished for it?

00:09:56.033 --> 00:09:58.661
If your statement is true,

00:09:58.744 --> 00:10:01.372
that it was an accident,
it's just simple negligence.

00:10:02.164 --> 00:10:04.583
You didn't need to flee from the scene.

00:10:08.587 --> 00:10:11.132
I was afraid of ruining the election.

00:10:16.971 --> 00:10:19.765
It was just a week before the election.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.606
It's already bad news
that his aide caused a car accident.

00:10:30.067 --> 00:10:31.736
What would people say

00:10:32.862 --> 00:10:36.073
if they found out
the victim happened to be his ex-lover?

00:10:40.995 --> 00:10:43.539
I was afraid
Mr. Hyun would lose the election…

00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.501
because of me.

00:11:28.667 --> 00:11:30.085
Have it when it's warm.

00:11:35.925 --> 00:11:37.593
I wasn't sure what you'd like.

00:12:00.324 --> 00:12:02.743
I realized I don't know much about you

00:12:04.078 --> 00:12:05.246
when you know

00:12:06.747 --> 00:12:08.541
everything about me.

00:12:26.433 --> 00:12:27.851
It's warm.

00:12:38.445 --> 00:12:40.447
Thank you for doing me a favor.

00:12:40.531 --> 00:12:42.658
Don't say that. It wasn't a favor.

00:12:42.741 --> 00:12:44.785
I just stepped out to smoke, that's all.

00:12:45.869 --> 00:12:47.371
Time flies.

00:12:48.789 --> 00:12:51.041
We first met here,
if I remember correctly.

00:12:51.709 --> 00:12:53.168
The high schooler who said

00:12:53.252 --> 00:12:55.629
he did no wrong
when he was caught after a fight

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:57.673
has now become a bodyguard.

00:12:59.717 --> 00:13:02.177
Had I not met you back then,

00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:03.846
I wouldn't have even become

00:13:03.929 --> 00:13:05.806
a functioning adult,
let alone a bodyguard.

00:13:07.641 --> 00:13:09.768
You're buttering me up with empty words.

00:13:09.852 --> 00:13:11.812
They're not empty words. I mean it.

00:13:11.895 --> 00:13:12.855
Forget it.

00:13:13.564 --> 00:13:15.816
Five minutes. I'll come back in five.

00:13:21.196 --> 00:13:22.823
QUESTIONING ROOM
RESTRICTED AREA

00:13:23.782 --> 00:13:25.117
You should've told me.

00:13:27.578 --> 00:13:29.872
Instead of burying it deep in your heart…

00:13:33.959 --> 00:13:35.711
and shouldering the burden alone.

00:13:39.173 --> 00:13:40.591
Had you told me…

00:13:45.012 --> 00:13:46.305
I'm sorry.

00:13:48.265 --> 00:13:49.808
I should apologize to you.

00:13:51.352 --> 00:13:53.520
You've become like that because of me.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.940
How can I shamelessly blame you?

00:14:02.529 --> 00:14:04.365
We worked together for 20 years,

00:14:07.076 --> 00:14:09.286
and I never offered any kind words to you.

00:14:10.412 --> 00:14:11.413
No.

00:14:13.999 --> 00:14:16.460
We never spoke comfortably.

00:14:17.711 --> 00:14:19.421
As an assemblyman and his aide,

00:14:20.089 --> 00:14:21.757
and as a candidate and his secretary,

00:14:22.424 --> 00:14:25.010
I was always on the receiving end
of your help.

00:14:29.056 --> 00:14:30.474
That must've been why.

00:14:32.393 --> 00:14:33.811
You were worried about me.

00:14:36.397 --> 00:14:37.606
You did it for me.

00:14:41.777 --> 00:14:43.737
This has nothing to do with you.

00:14:47.992 --> 00:14:50.202
It wasn't for you.

00:14:53.998 --> 00:14:55.624
It was for myself.

00:15:00.045 --> 00:15:01.630
So go back.

00:15:03.007 --> 00:15:04.008
You shouldn't

00:15:05.092 --> 00:15:07.428
be in this place.

00:15:35.998 --> 00:15:37.875
A person had died,

00:15:39.168 --> 00:15:41.211
but my first thought was,

00:15:41.795 --> 00:15:43.922
"What if I ruin the election?"

00:15:45.132 --> 00:15:46.800
Maybe that

00:15:47.468 --> 00:15:50.888
is a bigger crime than the hit-and-run.

00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:52.973
But

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.559
I covered my sin with another sin.

00:15:56.643 --> 00:16:00.564
I couldn't turn myself in
even after the election was over.

00:16:01.732 --> 00:16:03.150
Because I still

00:16:03.692 --> 00:16:05.527
had things left to do.

00:16:05.611 --> 00:16:06.904
Hyun Min-cheol!

00:16:06.987 --> 00:16:09.364
Will your wife accept it?

00:16:09.948 --> 00:16:11.450
She'll have a hard time doing so.

00:16:12.117 --> 00:16:14.161
She only fights
when she's sure she'll win.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.165
If she finds out
I'm starting a fight that I can't lose,

00:16:18.248 --> 00:16:20.626
she'll try to stop me, all the more so

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:22.127
if it's about her.

00:16:22.211 --> 00:16:25.005
-Hyun Min-cheol!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

00:16:25.089 --> 00:16:27.174
-Hyun Min-cheol!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

00:16:27.257 --> 00:16:31.929
When President-elect decided to get
divorced to get the special act passed,

00:16:32.763 --> 00:16:34.681
I decided too.

00:16:36.141 --> 00:16:38.393
That I'd hold off turning myself in

00:16:38.894 --> 00:16:40.771
until the special act was passed.

00:16:40.854 --> 00:16:42.106
Lawyer Song.

00:16:44.149 --> 00:16:46.068
About turning myself in to the police,

00:16:46.735 --> 00:16:48.403
I'll put it off for a few days.

00:16:52.449 --> 00:16:54.243
I still have something left to do.

00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:20.602
I was afraid

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.857
I would ruin the election.

00:17:30.863 --> 00:17:32.364
LATE EOM SUN-JEONG

00:17:35.868 --> 00:17:37.327
I had to

00:17:37.411 --> 00:17:40.372
keep the promise I made with your dad.

00:18:06.732 --> 00:18:08.734
Our Gang-myeong.

00:18:11.695 --> 00:18:13.572
Our son.

00:18:16.491 --> 00:18:17.743
Please make sure

00:18:19.578 --> 00:18:21.872
he'll live in the world

00:18:23.874 --> 00:18:26.084
that's different from mine.

00:18:26.168 --> 00:18:27.377
The promise

00:18:28.086 --> 00:18:32.466
that I'd make sure you live in the world
that's different from his.

00:18:33.217 --> 00:18:36.803
Making Hyun Min-cheol president

00:18:37.888 --> 00:18:40.182
and passing the special act,

00:18:40.933 --> 00:18:44.770
I did it all to keep the promise
I made with your dad.

00:18:44.853 --> 00:18:48.690
I understand.
Don't strain yourself to speak.

00:18:48.774 --> 00:18:50.317
You…

00:18:52.569 --> 00:18:54.071
can do it.

00:18:56.907 --> 00:18:59.952
I believe…

00:19:02.412 --> 00:19:03.580
in you.

00:19:16.134 --> 00:19:18.053
Honey.

00:19:18.971 --> 00:19:20.013
Honey.

00:19:24.893 --> 00:19:27.354
Honey.

00:19:33.568 --> 00:19:35.070
Honey.

00:19:45.747 --> 00:19:48.583
Just like you still remember everything

00:19:48.667 --> 00:19:50.085
your dad said

00:19:50.961 --> 00:19:54.423
and how he played with you
when you were only seven,

00:19:55.966 --> 00:19:57.884
remember me too, okay?

00:20:03.098 --> 00:20:04.933
Remember me too, okay?

00:20:06.351 --> 00:20:07.769
What are you talking about?

00:20:10.647 --> 00:20:12.316
I'm just jealous.

00:20:12.899 --> 00:20:15.902
I'll be jealous if you don't remember me
like you remember your dad.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:20.824
This won't do. You should have some beer.

00:20:22.326 --> 00:20:24.703
-Can I?
-Alcohol is the best cure for jealousy.

00:20:25.954 --> 00:20:28.665
My boy is so smart.

00:20:28.749 --> 00:20:29.708
Give me one second.

00:20:47.017 --> 00:20:49.478
I wanted to see you in a summer uniform.

00:20:49.561 --> 00:20:52.356
I thought that was the only day
I could see you in it.

00:20:53.023 --> 00:20:55.150
Good night, my dear son.

00:20:56.068 --> 00:20:57.277
From the day

00:20:57.361 --> 00:21:00.530
I first met you until now,

00:21:00.614 --> 00:21:02.491
I remember every moment.

00:21:14.211 --> 00:21:15.962
In that every moment,

00:21:16.588 --> 00:21:18.465
you were a gift

00:21:18.548 --> 00:21:20.217
and a blessing to me.

00:21:24.721 --> 00:21:26.181
I love you, son.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:01.174
Ms. Sung…

00:22:02.801 --> 00:22:04.219
will be fine.

00:22:05.512 --> 00:22:06.471
Don't worry.

00:22:07.597 --> 00:22:09.599
She'll come out soon.

00:22:21.403 --> 00:22:23.947
We removed the hematomas
caused by cerebral hemorrhage.

00:22:25.115 --> 00:22:28.201
To minimize the damage
caused by the accident and surgery,

00:22:28.285 --> 00:22:30.829
we put her in an induced coma.

00:22:30.912 --> 00:22:32.372
Induced coma?

00:22:32.956 --> 00:22:34.249
Did something go wrong?

00:22:34.958 --> 00:22:35.792
Honey.

00:22:36.376 --> 00:22:37.586
As I said,

00:22:38.253 --> 00:22:40.505
it's to prevent potential damage.

00:22:41.089 --> 00:22:42.716
The surgery went well,

00:22:42.799 --> 00:22:46.428
but we can't be sure when she'll wake up
or if she'll suffer any disability

00:22:48.013 --> 00:22:49.139
or aftermath.

00:22:50.348 --> 00:22:52.475
Let's give it some time and wait.

00:22:53.768 --> 00:22:55.520
How long must I wait?

00:22:55.604 --> 00:22:57.814
Until when must I wait?

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:10.076
It could take several days.

00:23:11.453 --> 00:23:13.330
-Honey.
-Mom.

00:23:40.649 --> 00:23:41.858
Will you be okay?

00:23:42.817 --> 00:23:44.861
You can tell the school and rest today.

00:23:45.362 --> 00:23:48.865
I don't want to go to school either,
but Ms. Sung said

00:23:50.617 --> 00:23:53.078
you must go to school
even if you don't want to.

00:23:53.662 --> 00:23:55.038
Will you really be okay alone?

00:23:56.331 --> 00:23:57.457
I'm not a child.

00:23:59.209 --> 00:24:01.044
Take good care of Mom.

00:24:01.628 --> 00:24:02.837
It must be hard for her.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.217
Don't worry.

00:24:21.022 --> 00:24:22.190
I'm sorry.

00:24:23.817 --> 00:24:25.402
I doubted you.

00:24:27.654 --> 00:24:29.614
I thought it was just an accident.

00:24:33.368 --> 00:24:35.453
But the moment I saw the dashcam footage,

00:24:37.747 --> 00:24:39.833
my mind turned into hell.

00:24:44.087 --> 00:24:46.256
Not just because I doubted you.

00:24:46.923 --> 00:24:49.634
Whether it was
politically in or against my favor…

00:24:52.387 --> 00:24:54.389
I found myself weighing it.

00:24:54.973 --> 00:24:57.475
Whether something happened to you or not,

00:24:59.728 --> 00:25:02.856
I only thought about
its political pros and cons. It was hell.

00:25:10.155 --> 00:25:12.991
When I met Lawyer Kwon,
he said a sword doesn't

00:25:15.243 --> 00:25:17.037
discriminate who it hurts.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.040
That you could become
the subject of the investigation.

00:25:21.541 --> 00:25:23.001
Do you know what I thought

00:25:23.501 --> 00:25:25.337
when I heard that?

00:25:28.757 --> 00:25:31.051
Nobody pushed me into this hell.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.349
I've become hell myself.

00:25:52.197 --> 00:25:53.865
That's the course of nature.

00:25:53.948 --> 00:25:56.201
Weighing the political pros and cons

00:25:56.951 --> 00:25:58.912
and making the most favorable choice.

00:26:03.249 --> 00:26:04.626
That's what

00:26:05.251 --> 00:26:06.461
a president should do.

00:26:11.966 --> 00:26:13.093
Su-yeon.

00:26:15.637 --> 00:26:18.306
Tell me if you're involved
with Chairman Yang in any way.

00:26:20.433 --> 00:26:22.185
This is the last chance.

00:26:22.769 --> 00:26:25.480
Must you do this

00:26:26.064 --> 00:26:27.399
even now?

00:26:28.483 --> 00:26:30.693
Don't you see Ms. Sung bedridden?

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:36.241
How can you bring up Chairman Yang
and the special act now?

00:26:36.324 --> 00:26:37.534
Is that so important?

00:26:45.875 --> 00:26:47.961
She's in that state because of…

00:26:48.044 --> 00:26:48.920
Because of whom?

00:26:50.672 --> 00:26:52.173
Because of Chairman Yang?

00:26:53.341 --> 00:26:54.342
No.

00:26:56.511 --> 00:26:57.554
Because of me.

00:26:59.597 --> 00:27:00.974
It's my fault.

00:27:01.057 --> 00:27:02.100
It's my fault!

00:27:02.183 --> 00:27:04.394
It's all my fault!

00:27:04.477 --> 00:27:07.272
She's hurt because of me!
It's all my fault!

00:27:07.355 --> 00:27:08.565
Don't shoulder it on your own!

00:27:11.484 --> 00:27:13.194
We're married.

00:27:15.196 --> 00:27:17.574
Whatever wrongdoings you've done,

00:27:18.158 --> 00:27:19.409
it's not too late now.

00:27:20.535 --> 00:27:22.203
So tell me what happened

00:27:22.287 --> 00:27:24.497
between you and Chairman Yang.

00:27:26.124 --> 00:27:27.083
What did you do?

00:27:30.003 --> 00:27:30.879
Leave.

00:27:30.962 --> 00:27:32.088
Honey.

00:27:32.172 --> 00:27:34.007
I've nothing to say to you.

00:27:42.932 --> 00:27:44.726
Hyun Min-cheol, step down!

00:27:44.809 --> 00:27:46.644
-Step down!
-Step down!

00:27:46.728 --> 00:27:48.605
Hyun Min-cheol, explain!

00:27:48.688 --> 00:27:50.482
-Explain!
-Explain!

00:27:50.565 --> 00:27:52.525
An illegitimate child is ridiculous!

00:27:52.609 --> 00:27:54.319
-It's ridiculous!
-It's ridiculous!

00:27:54.402 --> 00:27:56.237
Hyun Min-cheol, step down!

00:27:56.321 --> 00:27:58.114
-Step down!
-Step down!

00:27:58.198 --> 00:28:00.074
Hyun Min-cheol, explain!

00:28:00.158 --> 00:28:02.285
-Explain!
-Explain!

00:28:02.368 --> 00:28:04.204
An illegitimate child is ridiculous!

00:28:04.287 --> 00:28:06.080
-It's ridiculous!
-It's ridiculous!

00:28:06.164 --> 00:28:08.082
Hyun Min-cheol, step down!

00:28:08.166 --> 00:28:10.585
-Step down!
-Step down!

00:28:14.797 --> 00:28:17.425
HYUN MIN-CHEOL OUT!

00:28:17.509 --> 00:28:19.010
I apologize.

00:28:22.055 --> 00:28:23.515
I sincerely apologize

00:28:24.516 --> 00:28:25.725
with my head down.

00:28:27.143 --> 00:28:28.686
Frequent apologies.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.189
Apologies that are all words.

00:28:31.272 --> 00:28:33.233
You might've become

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.153
tired of listening to my apologies now.

00:28:39.823 --> 00:28:42.659
I'll answer your questions first.

00:28:44.577 --> 00:28:46.079
My closest coworker

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.832
who's worked with me for 20 years

00:28:49.791 --> 00:28:52.919
turned herself in last night
for the hit-and run incident.

00:28:54.337 --> 00:28:55.463
It's true.

00:28:57.549 --> 00:29:00.134
But the allegation
that I am involved in the case

00:29:00.718 --> 00:29:01.970
is false.

00:29:02.554 --> 00:29:04.347
Some are using the allegations

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:07.058
to try and stop
the Do Tae-hun special act.

00:29:08.476 --> 00:29:11.729
Special Committee was launched
to fulfill the people's wish.

00:29:13.273 --> 00:29:16.317
It will get to the bottom of the fire.

00:29:16.818 --> 00:29:18.403
If anyone had broken the law,

00:29:19.153 --> 00:29:20.530
there will be no exception.

00:29:20.613 --> 00:29:21.990
Be it Chairman Yang,

00:29:23.324 --> 00:29:24.701
President Yu,

00:29:25.326 --> 00:29:26.369
or my wife,

00:29:28.121 --> 00:29:31.207
anyone can become
the subject of the investigation.

00:29:33.293 --> 00:29:34.502
That goes for me

00:29:35.086 --> 00:29:36.337
as well.

00:29:36.421 --> 00:29:38.256
Hyun Min-cheol, step down!

00:29:38.339 --> 00:29:40.008
-Step down!
-Step down!

00:29:40.091 --> 00:29:41.926
Hyun Min-cheol, step down!

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:43.720
-Step down!
-Step down!

00:29:43.803 --> 00:29:45.430
Hyun Min-cheol, step down!

00:29:45.513 --> 00:29:46.347
Step down!

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.107
Have a good sleep.

00:29:57.025 --> 00:29:58.568
I'll be back soon.

00:30:25.511 --> 00:30:27.180
Hyun Min-cheol, step down!

00:30:27.263 --> 00:30:28.973
-Step down!
-Step down!

00:30:29.057 --> 00:30:30.850
Hyun Min-cheol, step down!

00:30:30.934 --> 00:30:32.685
-Step down!
-Step down!

00:30:32.769 --> 00:30:34.687
Hyun Min-cheol, step down!

00:30:34.771 --> 00:30:36.439
-Step down!
-Step down!

00:30:36.522 --> 00:30:38.358
Hyun Min-cheol, step down!

00:30:38.441 --> 00:30:40.485
-Step down!
-Step down!

00:30:54.624 --> 00:30:55.750
If the investigation

00:30:57.877 --> 00:31:00.505
reveals that I or my wife
was involved in the fire,

00:31:02.715 --> 00:31:03.800
I will step down…

00:31:05.551 --> 00:31:07.178
from my president-elect position

00:31:07.929 --> 00:31:09.013
immediately.

00:31:11.724 --> 00:31:14.185
-Step down!
-Step down!

00:31:14.268 --> 00:31:17.897
President-elect announced
he would step down from his position

00:31:17.981 --> 00:31:21.693
if the suspicion of him being involved
in the fire turn out to be true.

00:31:21.776 --> 00:31:24.529
After the press conference,
he met the party leaders

00:31:24.612 --> 00:31:26.990
and brought about an agreement to replace

00:31:27.073 --> 00:31:29.367
the chair of the Special Committee.

00:31:32.704 --> 00:31:33.830
Destroy them all.

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.333
Get rid of everything
that could become evidence.

00:31:37.917 --> 00:31:38.876
No.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.921
They didn't exist to begin with, got it?

00:31:49.887 --> 00:31:50.888
Damn it.

00:31:50.972 --> 00:31:52.432
You can't go in.

00:32:05.403 --> 00:32:06.529
It's fine.

00:32:06.612 --> 00:32:07.447
You may leave.

00:32:19.417 --> 00:32:21.794
Sis, what brings you here
without a heads-up?

00:32:27.091 --> 00:32:28.509
It's a bit messy, isn't it?

00:32:28.593 --> 00:32:30.094
I was redesigning the room.

00:32:30.178 --> 00:32:31.471
Nowadays,

00:32:31.554 --> 00:32:33.181
being minimalistic

00:32:33.264 --> 00:32:34.640
is the trend.

00:32:34.724 --> 00:32:36.601
I'm going to throw everything away

00:32:37.477 --> 00:32:38.478
and empty the room.

00:32:38.561 --> 00:32:39.812
Was it you?

00:32:41.314 --> 00:32:42.231
What do you mean?

00:32:42.315 --> 00:32:44.192
Ms. Sung's car accident.

00:32:45.026 --> 00:32:46.152
You did it, right?

00:32:48.863 --> 00:32:51.699
An accident is just an accident.
Why accuse me of it?

00:32:51.783 --> 00:32:54.327
What you're really afraid of
isn't the special act.

00:32:54.952 --> 00:32:56.162
Or the Special Committee.

00:32:57.789 --> 00:32:58.706
It's me.

00:33:05.171 --> 00:33:06.756
Isn't that why you did it?

00:33:06.839 --> 00:33:07.882
Darn it.

00:33:08.633 --> 00:33:10.843
I don't get what you're trying to say.

00:33:11.969 --> 00:33:15.389
You thought I'd get released
if Ms. Sung got to the police station.

00:33:16.057 --> 00:33:19.477
You want me to be the culprit
more than anyone else does.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:21.521
You must've planned to bury the act

00:33:21.604 --> 00:33:24.148
with the news
that I was the hit-and-run offender.

00:33:24.232 --> 00:33:26.275
Isn't that why you did

00:33:27.652 --> 00:33:30.154
such a horrible thing to Ms. Sung?

00:33:31.989 --> 00:33:35.743
Gosh, my sister is so quick to catch on.

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:37.578
So why did you do it?

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:39.705
What?

00:33:42.083 --> 00:33:46.420
A paternity test or whatever, I told you
not to do anything, but you ignored it.

00:33:46.504 --> 00:33:48.965
Why didn't you do as I said
and make things worse?

00:33:50.675 --> 00:33:54.387
If you keep acting out of place,
what will happen next?

00:33:54.971 --> 00:33:56.097
The news reports

00:33:56.722 --> 00:33:58.474
different accidents every day.

00:33:58.558 --> 00:34:00.226
But you know what?

00:34:00.309 --> 00:34:03.396
There's no such thing
as an accident that happens by chance.

00:34:04.188 --> 00:34:06.566
If they knew
why they got into the accidents,

00:34:06.649 --> 00:34:09.235
they wouldn't feel wronged at least,
you know?

00:34:09.318 --> 00:34:10.736
You're threatening me again?

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:11.946
I'm giving you

00:34:12.029 --> 00:34:14.657
a heads-up so that you won't feel wronged.

00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:17.243
You won't feel wronged too, then.

00:34:17.326 --> 00:34:18.870
What?

00:34:18.953 --> 00:34:20.454
What you can do,

00:34:21.164 --> 00:34:22.623
I can do as well.

00:34:28.462 --> 00:34:30.131
It's not difficult.

00:34:30.214 --> 00:34:32.842
You just need to open the door.

00:34:33.426 --> 00:34:37.763
Then Senior Inspector Jung
will go in and drag everyone out.

00:34:37.847 --> 00:34:39.140
So,

00:34:39.223 --> 00:34:42.977
make sure you go with Min-cheol
when he goes inside to negotiate.

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.104
So you can open the door.

00:34:45.813 --> 00:34:47.273
You know the Trojan Horse, right?

00:34:47.356 --> 00:34:48.274
MARCH 2012

00:34:48.357 --> 00:34:51.777
It isn't anything difficult,
but your role is very important.

00:34:52.361 --> 00:34:53.905
You must be very pressed.

00:34:54.947 --> 00:34:57.408
You, who chairs the sponsorship
for Jeong-yeon,

00:34:57.491 --> 00:34:59.202
are asking for my help.

00:35:01.787 --> 00:35:02.997
I am pressed.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.583
It's been more than three months

00:35:05.666 --> 00:35:08.294
since they locked up the factory
and started protesting.

00:35:08.377 --> 00:35:10.296
Father is rushing me to resolve it.

00:35:10.379 --> 00:35:11.505
And my younger brother

00:35:12.465 --> 00:35:16.469
is brown-nosing my father
and saying I'm not competent enough.

00:35:16.552 --> 00:35:18.346
I'm in a serious bind.

00:35:20.097 --> 00:35:21.015
You'll help me, right?

00:35:22.099 --> 00:35:23.267
Why would I?

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:27.647
The election is around the corner,

00:35:28.648 --> 00:35:30.483
but you're losing to Cha Jeong-yeon.

00:35:31.275 --> 00:35:32.652
Will you lose the election?

00:35:32.735 --> 00:35:34.111
I'll help you win.

00:35:34.195 --> 00:35:35.363
You will?

00:35:37.198 --> 00:35:38.324
How?

00:35:42.662 --> 00:35:43.913
Cha Jeong-yeon…

00:35:45.414 --> 00:35:47.208
has an illegal election committee.

00:35:48.709 --> 00:35:52.255
And Senior Inspector Jung here
runs the election committee.

00:35:52.338 --> 00:35:55.049
He's a jack of all trades, you see.

00:35:55.132 --> 00:35:58.719
Just get the reporters ready.
I'll help them catch them in the act.

00:35:58.803 --> 00:36:01.722
Then Cha Jeong-yeon's approval rating
will plummet.

00:36:02.598 --> 00:36:04.976
Who'd vote for the one who'd be taken down

00:36:05.059 --> 00:36:07.645
for violating the election act
even if he won?

00:36:08.646 --> 00:36:11.399
Their vote is the only thing
the people have,

00:36:11.482 --> 00:36:14.694
and they can't stand
their votes going to waste.

00:36:17.571 --> 00:36:22.159
Did you chair his sponsorship committee
and provide him with manpower

00:36:22.243 --> 00:36:23.786
for a moment like this?

00:36:24.745 --> 00:36:26.414
To stab Cha Jeong-yeon in the back?

00:36:26.497 --> 00:36:28.207
It never hurts

00:36:28.291 --> 00:36:30.042
to play it safe with both sides.

00:36:30.126 --> 00:36:32.003
And I've realized

00:36:32.086 --> 00:36:35.047
your husband is
the better assemblyperson material.

00:36:41.345 --> 00:36:43.681
Just dismiss them, and nothing else.

00:36:44.557 --> 00:36:46.225
Don't hurt anyone.

00:36:46.309 --> 00:36:48.019
Don't worry.

00:36:48.894 --> 00:36:51.272
Min-cheol will come out without a scratch.

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.611
-Sis.
-Don't do anything.

00:36:58.279 --> 00:37:01.240
Don't even breathe.
Stay still as if you're dead.

00:37:01.324 --> 00:37:02.783
If you mess around again,

00:37:04.952 --> 00:37:06.370
then I'll reveal this.

00:37:07.747 --> 00:37:08.831
Sis.

00:37:08.914 --> 00:37:10.207
Come on, don't do this.

00:37:10.916 --> 00:37:13.252
If that gets out,
you won't be safe either.

00:37:13.336 --> 00:37:15.379
You just need to keep your mouth shut.

00:37:15.963 --> 00:37:19.050
Just like what you've done until now.
Nothing else.

00:37:19.759 --> 00:37:21.218
Fine, sis. That recording!

00:37:22.845 --> 00:37:24.430
I'll buy it.

00:37:24.513 --> 00:37:25.848
How much do you want?

00:37:25.931 --> 00:37:28.267
What do you want? What should I do?

00:37:28.851 --> 00:37:29.852
Pray.

00:37:31.103 --> 00:37:32.938
If Ms. Sung doesn't wake up,

00:37:34.273 --> 00:37:35.691
you're done for.

00:37:37.234 --> 00:37:38.486
Sis.

00:37:38.569 --> 00:37:39.987
Sis!

00:38:05.846 --> 00:38:06.764
Yes, Ms. Cha.

00:38:06.847 --> 00:38:09.725
Chairman Yang just entered
the connecting room.

00:38:10.684 --> 00:38:12.895
I checked the occupants of the next room.

00:38:13.687 --> 00:38:16.857
They're Mr. Noh Cheol-jae,
Ms. Han Kyung-ae, and Mr. Jo Hyun-seok.

00:38:16.941 --> 00:38:19.693
Please make good use of it in your work.

00:38:19.777 --> 00:38:22.738
It's under your drivers' names.

00:38:22.822 --> 00:38:26.075
I took pictures of the wine bottles
Chairman Yang had prepared.

00:38:33.207 --> 00:38:35.543
We'll perform a search and seizure.

00:38:35.626 --> 00:38:38.379
The search and seizure starts at 13:19.

00:38:46.637 --> 00:38:48.264
What I said earlier,

00:38:48.347 --> 00:38:51.684
did you relay it to Mr. Jo and Ms. Han?

00:38:51.767 --> 00:38:52.893
Of course.

00:38:52.977 --> 00:38:55.187
They'll stop interfering
with the Committee.

00:38:55.688 --> 00:38:57.982
The same goes for you, Mr. Noh.

00:38:58.065 --> 00:38:59.859
Don't worry.

00:39:02.403 --> 00:39:06.073
The Special Committee performed
a search and seizure on H Group.

00:39:06.157 --> 00:39:10.369
It took place only an hour
after the new chair was appointed.

00:39:10.453 --> 00:39:13.956
Former lawyer Kwon Hak-seon,
the new chair of the Special Committee,

00:39:14.039 --> 00:39:16.292
was the whistleblower of H Chemical.

00:39:16.375 --> 00:39:19.503
The special act investigation
is expected to speed up.

00:39:19.587 --> 00:39:21.881
This is all we have for today.

00:39:21.964 --> 00:39:23.007
Thank you.

00:39:27.678 --> 00:39:29.722
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:39:35.311 --> 00:39:36.604
Read questions for Hwa-jin?

00:39:37.813 --> 00:39:38.981
Didn't you see the news?

00:39:41.066 --> 00:39:42.651
You don't even watch your own news?

00:39:43.319 --> 00:39:45.988
The special act and Mr. Hyun's position
are at risk.

00:39:46.572 --> 00:39:48.532
Lee Hwa-jin? Illegitimate child?

00:39:49.533 --> 00:39:51.035
Nobody cares now.

00:39:51.118 --> 00:39:52.369
What's with you?

00:39:53.078 --> 00:39:56.040
I was going to overlook it,
but I guess I shouldn't.

00:39:57.124 --> 00:40:00.377
You knew beforehand
Shin Hae-rin was going to turn herself in.

00:40:01.712 --> 00:40:04.757
But you put an embargo on it
and let other reporters cover it?

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:07.343
It was my source's request.

00:40:08.093 --> 00:40:09.553
Whatever.

00:40:10.638 --> 00:40:12.223
Prepare Hwa-jin's interview.

00:40:12.306 --> 00:40:14.767
It's a follow-up,
so let's make it provocative.

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:17.561
Hwa-jin seemed to be very bold.

00:40:17.645 --> 00:40:19.063
Nudge her in the right place,

00:40:19.146 --> 00:40:21.565
and she could overshadow
President-elect and Ms. Cha.

00:40:21.649 --> 00:40:22.816
Cheon U-hyeok!

00:40:25.194 --> 00:40:26.195
What? What?!

00:40:26.862 --> 00:40:28.656
You're trying to change the flow

00:40:28.739 --> 00:40:31.283
of the news that's moved on
to the special act

00:40:31.367 --> 00:40:32.535
back to Hwa-jin. Why?

00:40:32.618 --> 00:40:34.161
Check the viewers' comments.

00:40:34.245 --> 00:40:36.455
They're all about Lee Hwa-jin.

00:40:36.539 --> 00:40:38.791
The special act? The search and seizure?

00:40:38.874 --> 00:40:41.669
Nobody cares about those headaches.

00:40:41.752 --> 00:40:45.214
In the end, viewers want
to see something provocative.

00:40:45.297 --> 00:40:47.091
What they're interested in--

00:40:47.174 --> 00:40:48.175
Eom Min-jeong.

00:40:52.388 --> 00:40:53.347
What?

00:40:54.265 --> 00:40:56.934
Why did you tell him
to keep it a secret that

00:40:57.685 --> 00:40:59.395
Lee Hwa-jin was Eom Min-jeong?

00:41:00.187 --> 00:41:02.147
Keep it, but don't tell Reporter Son.

00:41:02.731 --> 00:41:05.693
No, do not tell anyone else that

00:41:05.776 --> 00:41:07.570
Hwa-jin is actually Eom Min-jeong.

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:15.452
Let's just focus on the news.

00:41:16.161 --> 00:41:17.955
Let's just focus on being reporters.

00:41:18.539 --> 00:41:19.790
Don't even think of

00:41:20.374 --> 00:41:23.210
dipping your toe in politics

00:41:23.794 --> 00:41:25.713
when you're not cut out for it.

00:41:40.519 --> 00:41:42.438
PARK CHAN-DO

00:41:47.318 --> 00:41:48.360
Hello?

00:41:48.444 --> 00:41:50.154
I got a call from Secretary Bang.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:10.299
So you want to buy Secretary Bang's diary?

00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:18.599
I warned you that you couldn't protect
both Su-yeon and the special act.

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:20.434
But you forgot.

00:42:20.517 --> 00:42:22.102
The diary is just the start.

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:24.563
I'm sure

00:42:25.147 --> 00:42:27.483
someone knows what happened on that day.

00:42:29.276 --> 00:42:31.111
No matter how hard they try,

00:42:32.488 --> 00:42:33.864
the truth will be revealed.

00:42:38.327 --> 00:42:40.537
You replaced the chair of the Committee.

00:42:41.121 --> 00:42:45.918
You even risked your presidential position
and said you'd step down if you were found

00:42:47.503 --> 00:42:48.962
to be involved in the fire.

00:42:49.046 --> 00:42:51.674
I'll use every power I have

00:42:53.926 --> 00:42:55.552
to uncover the truth.

00:43:03.644 --> 00:43:04.978
All right, then.

00:43:11.652 --> 00:43:14.029
It's already been 15 years.

00:43:15.739 --> 00:43:17.116
It was two days

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.284
after the fire.

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:24.456
APRIL 4, 2012
D-7 TO THE ASSEMBLYPERSON ELECTION

00:43:29.253 --> 00:43:31.380
People aren't taking

00:43:32.089 --> 00:43:33.799
the H Chemical fire lightly.

00:43:34.383 --> 00:43:38.345
If we leave it like this,
no one can say where the sparks will fly.

00:43:38.429 --> 00:43:40.848
I will handle the police investigation.

00:43:41.515 --> 00:43:43.350
And you,

00:43:43.434 --> 00:43:44.852
please handle the media.

00:43:47.229 --> 00:43:49.148
If the media and police work together,

00:43:49.231 --> 00:43:50.941
it'll be an easy job

00:43:51.024 --> 00:43:54.403
to make it look like Do Tae-hun
was the arsonist and Hyun Min-cheol

00:43:56.155 --> 00:43:57.072
was behind it.

00:44:02.661 --> 00:44:04.913
But will the police do as you say?

00:44:05.873 --> 00:44:07.583
They don't have a choice.

00:44:07.666 --> 00:44:11.962
If word gets out that the police was
at fault, someone will have to step down.

00:44:12.755 --> 00:44:14.673
Nobody will want to step down.

00:44:15.257 --> 00:44:16.800
That's common sense.

00:44:17.593 --> 00:44:20.846
But sometimes, people with no common sense
can cause trouble.

00:44:20.929 --> 00:44:23.557
And when that happens,
things get out of control.

00:44:24.141 --> 00:44:25.350
Don't worry.

00:44:26.351 --> 00:44:30.022
The prosecutor in charge is Noh Cheol-jae,
and he's easily persuaded.

00:44:30.105 --> 00:44:32.232
I told him that he could join our party

00:44:32.316 --> 00:44:35.402
in the next general election
if he helped us with this.

00:44:35.486 --> 00:44:36.653
What about the evidence?

00:44:37.488 --> 00:44:40.157
It's still an investigation,
so it should look like one.

00:44:41.325 --> 00:44:42.701
We can just

00:44:42.785 --> 00:44:44.369
make evidence.

00:44:46.163 --> 00:44:47.831
H Chemical

00:44:47.915 --> 00:44:49.500
is a chemical plant.

00:44:50.083 --> 00:44:53.170
It's clear as day that
flammable chemicals would've

00:44:53.253 --> 00:44:54.588
made the fire bigger.

00:44:55.839 --> 00:44:58.634
Swap the chemicals
that should be in the plant

00:44:58.717 --> 00:45:01.345
with paint thinner
that should never be found there,

00:45:02.054 --> 00:45:03.430
and everything becomes simple.

00:45:04.306 --> 00:45:06.099
The direct cause of the fire was

00:45:06.183 --> 00:45:08.644
the paint thinner stacked up
in front of the plant.

00:45:08.727 --> 00:45:12.314
And Hyun Min-cheol ordered them
to barricade the entrance with it.

00:45:12.397 --> 00:45:16.860
Hyun Min-cheol elicited a labor-management
conflict to win the election,

00:45:17.528 --> 00:45:18.612
and the fire was

00:45:19.863 --> 00:45:20.989
staged by him.

00:45:23.158 --> 00:45:24.451
It sounds plausible.

00:45:25.118 --> 00:45:27.579
My son's election committee
can spread the word,

00:45:27.663 --> 00:45:29.831
and the media can jump on it.

00:45:33.919 --> 00:45:36.088
So, the public opinion was manipulated by

00:45:36.838 --> 00:45:38.715
the police, prosecution, and media.

00:45:41.885 --> 00:45:43.929
Next day, Su-yeon came to see him.

00:45:49.226 --> 00:45:50.269
Father.

00:45:51.311 --> 00:45:52.896
Please save him.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.357
I heard he survived the fire.

00:45:56.066 --> 00:45:58.443
If he ends up being framed for arson,

00:45:58.527 --> 00:46:00.445
his political life will be over.

00:46:01.405 --> 00:46:02.739
Please save him.

00:46:04.575 --> 00:46:05.826
Watch your mouth.

00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:07.744
People might get it wrong.

00:46:07.828 --> 00:46:10.289
I don't have the power to save anyone.

00:46:12.708 --> 00:46:14.668
I may be an illegitimate child,

00:46:15.877 --> 00:46:17.713
but I'm still your child.

00:46:17.796 --> 00:46:20.257
If my husband becomes the arsonist,

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:23.719
it will definitely affect
your presidential election negatively.

00:46:25.637 --> 00:46:28.515
You don't want this issue
to escalate as well.

00:46:28.599 --> 00:46:31.268
We won't deny that Do Tae-hun is

00:46:31.351 --> 00:46:32.477
the arsonist.

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:35.856
I'll also help
to keep things under control.

00:46:35.939 --> 00:46:37.024
Just exclude

00:46:37.774 --> 00:46:39.526
my husband from the investigation.

00:46:40.444 --> 00:46:44.948
Please stop the media from branding him
as the arsonist, Father.

00:46:45.032 --> 00:46:46.992
Are you saying my wife helped to frame…

00:46:49.036 --> 00:46:50.287
Do Tae-hun for arson?

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:53.707
That was just the start.

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:57.753
When the investigation and media
got out of your way,

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:00.380
Su-yeon came back.

00:47:00.464 --> 00:47:02.924
She suggested a new deal.

00:47:03.508 --> 00:47:04.509
A new deal?

00:47:14.811 --> 00:47:16.563
At the presidential primary,

00:47:17.564 --> 00:47:20.317
I'll make the floor leader win.

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:23.236
Putting the "how" aside,
how can I trust you?

00:47:25.614 --> 00:47:27.491
We have the same enemy.

00:47:29.201 --> 00:47:31.036
My father.

00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:35.457
Your father is your enemy?

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.167
My father taught me that

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:38.794
an election is like a war.

00:47:38.877 --> 00:47:40.212
What is it you want?

00:47:40.295 --> 00:47:41.421
Cha Jeong-yeon.

00:47:42.923 --> 00:47:44.341
I'll bring him down.

00:47:44.424 --> 00:47:47.177
And I want the floor leader
to turn a blind eye.

00:47:48.261 --> 00:47:49.930
When Cha Jeong-yeon falls,

00:47:50.013 --> 00:47:51.348
my father falls.

00:47:51.932 --> 00:47:53.308
Then the presidency

00:47:54.142 --> 00:47:55.811
will be the floor leader's.

00:48:04.611 --> 00:48:06.571
And you have a way to bring him down?

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:33.682
We'll expose Cha Jeong-yeon's
illegal election campaigning.

00:48:34.266 --> 00:48:37.769
He won't have time to defend himself
or change the public sentiment.

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:43.608
H Chemical will take responsibility for it
and leave Haseong.

00:48:43.692 --> 00:48:45.652
And Chairman Yang Yun-seung

00:48:45.736 --> 00:48:47.654
will step down from management.

00:49:07.257 --> 00:49:11.595
You'll settle the succession issue and
secure the reason to relocate to New Town?

00:49:11.678 --> 00:49:15.640
If the younger assemblymen of the party
pressure him after the election,

00:49:15.724 --> 00:49:17.893
my father won't be able to hold out.

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.562
He'll take responsibility for Jeong-yeon

00:49:21.062 --> 00:49:23.106
losing the election and step down.

00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:25.567
The hereditary nomination was a big issue,

00:49:26.067 --> 00:49:29.988
so if he loses the election in Haseong,
he won't avoid the responsibility.

00:49:30.572 --> 00:49:31.698
What do you think?

00:49:31.782 --> 00:49:34.576
If you agree,
we'll set it in motion immediately.

00:49:40.665 --> 00:49:41.541
Give it a go.

00:49:43.418 --> 00:49:45.629
You should do what you want.

00:49:46.588 --> 00:49:47.881
Thank you.

00:49:47.964 --> 00:49:49.049
I'm forever indebted.

00:49:49.132 --> 00:49:52.552
Did you two plan the labor-management
conflict from the start?

00:49:52.636 --> 00:49:54.179
To win the election?

00:49:54.846 --> 00:49:57.140
You even staged the fire?

00:49:57.224 --> 00:50:00.519
And due to an unexpected variable,
Candidate Hyun got injured badly?

00:50:02.854 --> 00:50:06.441
Illegal campaign can't be improvised
a few days before the election.

00:50:06.525 --> 00:50:07.984
How long did you plan it?

00:50:08.068 --> 00:50:10.821
Did you really stage the fire,

00:50:10.904 --> 00:50:12.572
risking Candidate Hyun's life,

00:50:12.656 --> 00:50:14.533
to bring down your father?

00:50:15.826 --> 00:50:17.035
To take revenge on him?

00:50:22.541 --> 00:50:24.709
That's not important now.

00:50:24.793 --> 00:50:27.087
What's important is,
we're in the same boat.

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:28.213
I heard

00:50:29.339 --> 00:50:32.008
Candidate Hyun
couldn't stand or walk ever again.

00:50:33.051 --> 00:50:35.220
Did you risk even that

00:50:35.303 --> 00:50:37.347
to win the election?

00:50:42.602 --> 00:50:43.645
He…

00:50:46.106 --> 00:50:48.233
will stand back up.

00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:50.193
And…

00:50:52.195 --> 00:50:54.990
he'll climb up to the position

00:50:56.324 --> 00:50:57.826
my father could never reach.

00:51:00.287 --> 00:51:01.246
I will

00:51:02.163 --> 00:51:04.207
make that happen.

00:51:20.098 --> 00:51:21.975
She wouldn't have done that.

00:51:23.643 --> 00:51:26.229
Why did you want
to buy Secretary Bang's diary?

00:51:28.148 --> 00:51:30.942
Wasn't it to discover the truth
about five years ago?

00:51:31.026 --> 00:51:35.572
Weren't you trying to find out
what deal we made with Su-yeon?

00:51:37.532 --> 00:51:39.117
When you and my husband were competing

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.161
at the presidential election
five years ago,

00:51:41.244 --> 00:51:44.331
the secret Su-yeon traded with us
using the recording

00:51:44.414 --> 00:51:48.209
was that she and Yang Hoon
elicited the labor-management conflict

00:51:48.293 --> 00:51:49.920
and staged the fire.

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.214
That can't be.

00:51:54.799 --> 00:51:55.717
No way.

00:51:56.343 --> 00:52:00.472
Why do you think she bugged you
and made sure you didn't meet us?

00:52:01.264 --> 00:52:05.435
Why do you think she was
so desperate to stop the special act?

00:52:12.025 --> 00:52:13.276
Are you saying

00:52:15.195 --> 00:52:17.030
she was really involved in the fire?

00:52:19.115 --> 00:52:21.076
That she's the one

00:52:22.327 --> 00:52:23.995
who caused the terrible fire?

00:52:25.246 --> 00:52:29.209
The person standing on the receiving end
of your special act isn't Yang Hoon.

00:52:30.418 --> 00:52:31.962
It's Su-yeon.

00:52:36.466 --> 00:52:38.885
Stop the illegal sit-in protest!

00:52:38.969 --> 00:52:41.388
APRIL 2, 2012
D-9 TO THE ASSEMBLYPERSON ELECTION

00:52:41.471 --> 00:52:44.015
Stop the illegal sit-in protest!

00:52:44.099 --> 00:52:46.351
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

00:52:47.394 --> 00:52:50.855
What you're doing is clearly illegal!

00:52:52.232 --> 00:52:53.650
Come out now!

00:52:54.859 --> 00:52:57.404
Stop the illegal sit-in protest!

00:52:57.487 --> 00:52:59.114
H CHEMICAL SIT-IN PROTEST

00:53:06.204 --> 00:53:08.915
WE REFUSE THE PLANT RELOCATION

00:53:33.606 --> 00:53:35.900
Stop the illegal sit-in protest!

00:53:35.984 --> 00:53:38.278
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

00:53:38.361 --> 00:53:41.156
Stop the illegal sit-in protest!

00:53:41.239 --> 00:53:43.324
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

00:53:43.408 --> 00:53:46.244
Stop the illegal sit-in protest!

00:53:46.327 --> 00:53:48.747
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

00:53:48.830 --> 00:53:51.041
Stop the illegal sit-in protest!

00:53:51.124 --> 00:53:53.626
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:56.379
Stop the illegal sit-in protest!

00:53:56.463 --> 00:53:58.965
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

00:53:59.049 --> 00:54:01.468
Stop the illegal sit-in protest!

00:54:01.551 --> 00:54:02.802
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:55.480
I'm not asking you
to dissolve the protest just because.

00:54:55.563 --> 00:54:57.148
It will be under conditions.

00:54:57.232 --> 00:54:59.734
And you think those conditions make sense?

00:54:59.818 --> 00:55:02.529
We can't be reinstated,
the plant will be relocated,

00:55:02.612 --> 00:55:06.199
and the management, including
the succession, is not up for discussion.

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:10.411
I mean, where are the conditions for us?

00:55:14.707 --> 00:55:16.334
If you stop the sit-in protest,

00:55:17.001 --> 00:55:20.088
Vice Chair Yang Hoon will talk with you.
He promised.

00:55:20.171 --> 00:55:22.048
We won't acknowledge Yang Hoon.

00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:26.261
He's the one who fired us.
What's there to talk about with him?

00:55:26.845 --> 00:55:29.430
We want to talk
to Chairman Yang Yun-seung.

00:55:29.514 --> 00:55:31.641
We'll never meet Yang Hoon.

00:55:32.225 --> 00:55:33.601
Let's take it one by one.

00:55:34.185 --> 00:55:36.855
Meet with Yang Hoon first,
and if it still doesn't work,

00:55:36.938 --> 00:55:39.107
I'll make sure to get Chairman Yang.

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:40.108
Goodness.

00:55:42.485 --> 00:55:44.946
It's so easy since your wife is a Yang.

00:55:45.655 --> 00:55:48.867
You can make him
come and go as you please?

00:55:50.118 --> 00:55:52.328
What's important now
is the public sentiment.

00:55:52.412 --> 00:55:54.330
To gain their support, you must talk--

00:55:54.414 --> 00:55:56.749
What about the compensation
he's demanding of us?

00:55:56.833 --> 00:55:59.294
They already cut off our bread and butter,

00:55:59.377 --> 00:56:00.879
and they're now choking us

00:56:00.962 --> 00:56:03.173
with the ridiculous demand
for compensation.

00:56:03.256 --> 00:56:06.718
Can that be solved by talking it out too?

00:56:07.302 --> 00:56:09.596
We need that solved first

00:56:10.346 --> 00:56:12.265
so that we can talk

00:56:12.348 --> 00:56:14.309
or negotiate or whatever.

00:56:16.728 --> 00:56:18.813
Lawyer Kwon and I are communicating

00:56:18.897 --> 00:56:21.649
with the company
so they will withdraw the lawsuit.

00:56:21.733 --> 00:56:23.484
So if you stop the protest first--

00:56:23.568 --> 00:56:24.652
Hyun Min-cheol!

00:56:25.737 --> 00:56:27.614
How are we to trust the company?

00:56:30.575 --> 00:56:32.493
Both the relocation and the lay-off

00:56:33.578 --> 00:56:36.623
were all discussed and settled
during the protest five years ago.

00:56:36.706 --> 00:56:40.460
But as soon as we stopped
the sit-in protest,

00:56:40.543 --> 00:56:42.921
the company nullified the negotiation.

00:56:43.004 --> 00:56:45.089
So how can we trust the company?

00:56:48.426 --> 00:56:50.386
If they go back on their word again,

00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:52.096
-I'll be responsible--
-What?

00:56:52.764 --> 00:56:54.557
Who are you to take responsibility?

00:56:55.308 --> 00:56:58.478
Become an assemblyman first
to say that, at least.

00:56:59.062 --> 00:57:00.939
Do you think I can't see through you?

00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:05.026
If you're putting on a show
because the election is near,

00:57:05.109 --> 00:57:06.194
just leave.

00:57:06.945 --> 00:57:07.946
Hold on.

00:57:12.033 --> 00:57:13.243
Everyone, calm down.

00:57:13.743 --> 00:57:15.453
He came to hear us out.

00:57:15.536 --> 00:57:16.955
Don't be so hard on him.

00:57:22.001 --> 00:57:23.253
After all,

00:57:23.336 --> 00:57:27.090
we used to work together as a family
and fight together as comrades.

00:57:28.091 --> 00:57:29.217
Tae-hun!

00:57:31.302 --> 00:57:32.345
I get it.

00:57:32.428 --> 00:57:35.473
I get it, so stop
being so worked up. Okay?

00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:40.979
Can we have a word for a moment?

00:57:47.068 --> 00:57:48.278
Wait here.

00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:51.864
This is insane.

00:57:54.617 --> 00:57:55.493
I'll be back.

00:58:21.811 --> 00:58:22.895
Hello?

00:58:24.314 --> 00:58:25.398
Now's the time.

00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:41.414
Where are you going?

00:58:41.497 --> 00:58:43.374
Something urgent came up.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.126
I'll go out first.

00:58:45.209 --> 00:58:46.336
You're going out now?

00:59:00.308 --> 00:59:01.517
Nothing, right?

00:59:02.101 --> 00:59:03.144
Yes, it's quiet.

00:59:04.729 --> 00:59:05.813
Then let her leave.

00:59:05.897 --> 00:59:07.482
Sure. Give me the key.

00:59:21.287 --> 00:59:22.497
You have a photo, right?

00:59:24.123 --> 00:59:25.041
What photo?

00:59:26.709 --> 00:59:27.960
Of your baby. No?

00:59:32.215 --> 00:59:33.508
Show me her picture.

01:00:01.285 --> 01:00:02.203
What?

01:00:02.286 --> 01:00:03.329
Who are you guys?

01:00:03.413 --> 01:00:05.790
Go further inside!

01:00:08.876 --> 01:00:10.461
Set everything on fire.

01:00:15.258 --> 01:00:16.217
Drag them all out!

01:00:16.718 --> 01:00:17.760
Let me go!

01:00:17.844 --> 01:00:18.886
In-kyu!

01:00:21.472 --> 01:00:22.849
Let me go!

01:00:22.932 --> 01:00:24.016
You planned this, right?

01:00:25.268 --> 01:00:27.019
Does Min-cheol know? Let me go!

01:00:29.939 --> 01:00:30.940
Come on.

01:00:38.573 --> 01:00:41.117
-Honey, run!
-Let go of me!

01:00:47.165 --> 01:00:49.250
Honey! Get lost, bastard!

01:00:49.333 --> 01:00:50.585
Honey!

01:00:52.003 --> 01:00:53.212
You bastard!

01:00:55.089 --> 01:00:57.008
-Fire!
-Fire!

01:01:10.229 --> 01:01:12.148
There are people here!

01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:13.775
Please!

01:01:13.858 --> 01:01:14.859
Honey.

01:01:15.485 --> 01:01:17.570
Honey!

01:01:18.988 --> 01:01:19.947
Honey!

01:01:20.656 --> 01:01:23.534
-Honey!
-It's dangerous. You must leave!

01:01:23.618 --> 01:01:25.453
-Honey!
-No. It's dangerous.

01:01:25.536 --> 01:01:27.205
Honey! Let go!

01:01:27.288 --> 01:01:30.291
Honey!

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:38.758
-You must go.
-You must go. It's dangerous!

01:01:38.841 --> 01:01:41.385
-No, honey!
-Be careful.

01:01:41.469 --> 01:01:43.346
Honey! Let me go!

01:01:43.429 --> 01:01:45.515
Honey!

01:01:45.598 --> 01:01:47.475
Honey!

01:01:47.558 --> 01:01:49.477
Honey!

01:01:54.357 --> 01:01:57.693
The person who'll bleed
from the special act

01:01:58.444 --> 01:01:59.946
is you, President-elect.

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:03.199
Since you promised
to step down from your position,

01:02:03.282 --> 01:02:05.660
you won't be able to protect Su-yeon

01:02:06.702 --> 01:02:08.621
or even yourself.

01:02:11.916 --> 01:02:13.125
-Get out!
-Tae-hun!

01:02:14.252 --> 01:02:15.419
Do Tae-hun!

01:02:16.003 --> 01:02:16.921
Tae-hun!

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.349
On the day of the fire 15 years ago,

01:03:10.433 --> 01:03:12.977
who killed my parents?

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:14.770
I didn't love you.

01:03:15.813 --> 01:03:18.482
I just needed someone to make president.

01:03:18.566 --> 01:03:20.610
What should I do now?

01:03:21.193 --> 01:03:23.070
Ji-yu is with me.

01:03:23.154 --> 01:03:24.447
You're the evidence, sis.

01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:25.740
Just let Ji-yu go.

01:03:25.823 --> 01:03:27.658
I should've realized

01:03:27.742 --> 01:03:29.827
why you did that.

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:34.290
If there's a victim,
there should be a perpetrator.

01:03:35.541 --> 01:03:37.543
