=Episode 6=

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.200
You're calling her mother?

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.200
Auntie is my mother, not you.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.960
How could you claim someone else

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.250
as your mother before all the witnesses?

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.680
Could it be that the recent rumors

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.350
are true?

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.280
Wanning,

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.640
it's just a child's angry words.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.200
Don't take it seriously.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.150
That's right.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.680
It must be that Ping's spent much time

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.400
with Qingqing and developed

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.680
affection for her.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.070
She's like a mother to him.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.350
Madam Xu,

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.710
please don't be angry.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.120
I've grown closer to Ping lately,

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.770
and I can't bear to see him punished.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.790
He just misspoke just now.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.920
Please stop scolding Ping.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.330
Ping,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.070
go apologize to your mother.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.000
- Go now.
- Mother, I don't want her.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.840
I don't want her.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.750
Nonsense!

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.710
Who is your mother?

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.120
Enough.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.710
The rumors are getting out of hand,

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.840
and there's been such a scene today.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.950
If word gets out,

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.360
it'd not only tarnish the name of the Marquis

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.040
but also jeopardize mother's selection
for First-Rank Lady.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.800
To put an end to the rumors,

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.280
we must demolish them entirely.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.430
How about this?

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.910
Since Ping is my child,

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.490
why not perform a test to prove it?

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.680
So that everyone will know

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.430
who Ping's mother truly is.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.080
That will silence them.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.710
And let Ping know

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.470
who his real mother is.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.300
Wanning, there is no need for this.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.430
Leave the rumors for me to handle.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.800
Do you have a better solution?

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.560
Wanning,

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.360
forget about this blood-test idea.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.280
I don't think that method is reliable.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.240
What if something goes wrong?

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.870
Won't that invite even more ridicule?

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.630
I do have a solution.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.240
Physician Pei.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.630
Since you could cure Ping's illness,

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.840
surely you can solve this as well.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.120
What method do you propose?

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.240
Just drip the blood of Madam Xu,

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.400
Young Master Ping, and Miss Qingqing

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.520
into water.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.590
Whoever the real mother is,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.400
her blood will merge with his.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.710
In that way,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.590
the truth will reveal itself.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.910
Excellent. I'll go first.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.120
Qingqing?

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.840
Don't you want

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.360
to clarify the rumors for the Marquis?

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.520
Ping.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.000
I don't want to. It hurts.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.430
Enough.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.150
A blood-test to prove the kinship?

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.560
If word gets out, it will be a laughingstock.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.750
Xu Wannning,

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.190
could it be that you've
planned this all along?

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.310
Deliberately telling everyone
that Ping is not your child,

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.540
using it to abandon Ping

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.750
and elope with the physician?

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.120
I wondered why she's been so close

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.000
to the physician lately.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.750
Turns out you had other intentions.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.270
If you are afraid to do it, just admit it.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.830
How dare you turn around and blame us?

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.750
What's there for us to be afraid of?

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.390
You're the unfaithful one.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.800
Just like before.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.870
Marquis, perhaps you should look at this

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:58.870
before accusing others.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.560
This was found in your study.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.680
As for whose it is,

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.680
I believe Miss Qingqing

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.160
should be able to tell.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.270
If any of you'd like more evidence,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
I have more to show.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.560
Very well.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.190
What fine sworn siblings.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.360
So you've been deceiving me all along.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.390
One is the husband I trusted,

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.920
the other is the sister I treated
with kindness.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.070
How could you do such things?

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.480
Wanning,

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.070
this is a misunderstanding.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.070
Misunderstanding?

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.200
Mother,

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.390
the evidence is right here.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.430
How could you say that?

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.270
That's enough.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.870
It's normal for a man to have concubines.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.320
Besides,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.680
I am a Marquis.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.190
Must I remain faithful to only you for life?

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.480
Cui Yunfeng,

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.120
you've finally admitted the truth.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.240
Then tell me this.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.750
Is Ping truly my child

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.270
or hers?

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.270
Ping is, of course, your child.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.750
What does my affair with Qingqing

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.510
have to do with Ping?

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.510
You carried him and gave birth to him.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.630
I gave birth to him?

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.310
What a coincidence.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.240
Days ago, I ran into the midwife
who delivered my baby.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.480
She said that the child had a birthmark.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.360
Is the birthmark on Ping

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.920
even real?

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.160
Speak!

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.360
You bunch of liars.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.870
Ping is not my child at all.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:34.800
Tell me.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.270
Where did you hide my child?

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.880
Wanning.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.830
We kept this from you

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.560
for fear of hurting you.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.830
Back when you gave birth,

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.750
the child was a stillborn.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.310
We brought Ping here

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.040
because we didn't want you to be sad

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.190
and wanted you to recover quickly.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.560
A stillborn?

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.240
Our family has never been unfair to you.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.240
Now that you're being so unreasonable,

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.270
where does that leave our reputation?

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.750
Since mother has said so,

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:16.920
I believe you.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.160
However,

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.510
if you want me not to drop it,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.160
in this residence,

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.750
Ping can only have me as his mother.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.080
Fine.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.310
I will settle this as you wish.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.920
I need to get some fresh air.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.120
Madam Xu.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.320
Cuiyun,

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.310
confine Bai Qingqing

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.430
and let her reflect on her actions.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:56.670
Lady Cui,

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.920
I know my mistake.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.480
I won't do this again.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.680
Please, don't confine me.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.600
Marquis.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:05.500
You are to blame

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.680
for causing such trouble.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.360
Mother wants you to reflect,

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:09.870
so reflect properly.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:13.830
Take her away.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.920
Thank you for your help, Commander.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.310
While the test is a farce,

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.720
it did help you sound them out.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.760
About the one you were looking for…

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:28.310
Just as you said.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.800
I did some thinking.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.790
The incense burner in Cui Qingping's room

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.240
belonged to Cuiyun, Lady Cui's maid.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.270
You don't need to tell me that.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.320
Indeed.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.510
Madam Xu probably wouldn't believe

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.080
Lady Cui's words easily.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.750
(Since they care so much about reputation,)

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.240
(I must put on a good show.)

00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:00.100
(Marquis's Mansion in Yan City)

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.390
Isn't that the Marquis's wife?

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.150
What's going on here?

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.550
Yes, it looks festive.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.750
Madam, what happy occasion is this?

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.440
I, Xu Wanning, am beating this gong

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.270
not only to gather everyone here

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.360
for some excitement,

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.840
but also to tell you some stories
about the Cui Family.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.670
Xu Wannning, what are you doing?

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:17.840
What stories?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.840
Yunfeng,

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.720
our family is renowned and respected

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.840
throughout Yan City.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.630
So I want to tell everyone

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.750
all the good deeds you've done
over the years.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:29.750
Wanning,

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.670
are you going to drag the family
through the mud like this?

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.670
You forced me into this.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.790
If my husband and mother-in-law are willing

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.440
to answer my question,

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:45.150
I won't need to tell stories here.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.040
Fine.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.000
I'll tell you everything

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.390
you want to know.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.600
Since Lady Cui has said so,

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.910
I still want to tell everyone

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.320
about the good news in our family.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.240
- Xu Wannning.
- The good news is

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.240
that in three days,
it'll be Lady Cui's birthday,

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.320
and we want to invite everyone in the city

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.840
to come and celebrate with us.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.910
Everyone, what do you say?

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.550
Great!

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.510
We will see you in three days.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.160
Mother.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.120
All right.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:23.820
(Marquis's Mansion in Yan City)

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.080
Where is my child?

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.910
You'd better tell me right now.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.040
Wanning,

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.510
Mother just fainted.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:30.630
I don't know either.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.170
Are you sure you won't tell me?

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:37.910
I'll kill you.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.360
Xu Wannning, you're crazy.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:40.870
You drove me to it!

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:43.750
Stop it.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.960
Mother, awake already?

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.440
Xu Wanning,

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.240
you certainly have your methods.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.800
Fine.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.390
I can tell you.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.600
But I have no idea

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.380
whether that child is alive or dead.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.020
Beat him!

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.390
Don't hold back!

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.790
Leaving a newly born baby in such a place,

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.870
you people are so heartless.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.870
When the child was born,

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.840
he was barely alive.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.840
The doctor examined him and said

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.100
he was likely dull-witted
and couldn't be raised.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.030
How could our esteemed family

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:58.440
accept such a legitimate heir?

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.340
Mother then ordered someone to take him away.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.530
According to that person,

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:04.030
he was abandoned here.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.030
You'd better pray he's still alive.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.030
If he didn't survive,

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:11.750
it has nothing to do with me.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.000
Kids, could you come over here?

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.000
That child

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.510
died in the first snow six years ago.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.750
It's snowing.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.750
It's snowing.
