I'm asking if you like him?

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.640
You like him.

[Episode 3]
Ugh! What is this feeling?

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.896
Do you like Seon Ho?

00:01:20.896 --> 00:01:24.120
What am I supposed to do?

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.940
Why can't you say it?

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.510
Why can't you say it?

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.630
"I like him."

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.660
"He's my soulmate."

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.600
Why can't you say it?

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.880
Did I do something wrong again?

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.714
- Should I have told him?
- Are you crazy?

00:01:37.714 --> 00:01:39.428
You did well this time.

00:01:39.428 --> 00:01:42.411
- Your shyness and lameness saved you.
- What?

00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:45.131
What are you staring at? You already know.

00:01:45.131 --> 00:01:46.765
If you admit it,

00:01:46.765 --> 00:01:49.337
it's only a matter of time
before Seon Ho finds out.

00:01:50.537 --> 00:01:55.230
- He's not the type to tell.
- No, he isn't.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.830
But you know, even if you can trust the person,
you can't trust the situation.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.748
A situation could arise where he just
blurts it out without realizing it.

00:02:04.285 --> 00:02:05.737
Shall we continue our conversation?

00:02:05.737 --> 00:02:09.565
Do you hate it or like it if Seon Ho finds out?

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.857
- I hate it.
- Why?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.874
Because I'll definitely get rejected.

00:02:19.874 --> 00:02:21.920
Just thinking about it makes me cringe.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.205
Shut up, okay?

00:02:29.234 --> 00:02:31.100
Okay.

00:02:33.645 --> 00:02:36.870
Goodnight, love you.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.820
No way!

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.582
How did he know?

00:02:48.582 --> 00:02:50.868
Not knowing would've been weird.

00:02:50.868 --> 00:02:52.617
It's so obvious.

00:02:52.617 --> 00:02:54.150
You must have been giving it away, right?

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.731
You just saw his face and
smiled like an idiot, didn't you?

00:02:56.731 --> 00:02:58.880
Have some pride.

00:03:00.468 --> 00:03:02.285
So? What did he say?

00:03:02.285 --> 00:03:04.137
No idea.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.660
He just said, 'you like him,' and left.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.914
Just like that?

00:03:08.914 --> 00:03:12.240
What was his tone when he said, 'you like him'?

00:03:13.154 --> 00:03:14.530
Gosh, I can't tell.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.300
I was too shocked.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.571
Like making fun of you?

00:03:20.045 --> 00:03:23.332
- Look closely, ta-da!
- You like him.

00:03:23.332 --> 00:03:26.948
- Why push me?
- You like him.

00:03:28.068 --> 00:03:30.208
You like him.

00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:31.268
You like him.

00:03:31.268 --> 00:03:33.570
Ugh, it's all mixed up.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.872
Do you like him?

00:03:38.848 --> 00:03:40.704
You like him.

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:44.537
But he seemed angry.

00:03:44.537 --> 00:03:47.050
- Angry?
- Yeah.

00:03:50.868 --> 00:03:52.070
Right, that's it.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.200
Furious, completely pissed off.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.274
I heard his sister and that guy like each other.

00:03:56.274 --> 00:03:58.400
No, she said they're just friends.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.251
'Just friends' between a guy and a girl? Nonsense.

00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:01.680
They're clearly flirting.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.674
He's mad you might interfere
with his sister's love life.

00:04:04.674 --> 00:04:07.268
Even if their sibling chemistry is
fire, his sister matters most.

00:04:07.268 --> 00:04:09.280
Why would some random girl matter?

00:04:11.348 --> 00:04:15.211
- Right?
- Maybe he's just mad that she likes him.

00:04:15.907 --> 00:04:17.577
Gosh.

00:04:17.577 --> 00:04:18.948
Dude, I got the chills.

00:04:18.948 --> 00:04:22.400
True friends wake you up harshly
when needed, even if it hurts.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.611
Where's the proof that I'm wrong?

00:04:23.611 --> 00:04:24.660
It's right here.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.690
Watch carefully again.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.644
Ta-da! Crazy chemistry!

00:04:33.066 --> 00:04:35.200
U Yeon.

00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:41.620
Nam Gi Jeong! Ta-da! Insane!

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.860
All three have model vibes.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.610
Even if you make that sad
face, it can't be helped.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.780
Chemistry is science.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.430
There's no particular reason
for Nam Gi Jeong to like U Yeon,

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.580
but are there plenty of reasons
for him not to like her?

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.340
Isn't it obvious?

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.780
- He's a model.
- Hey.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.288
We're not talking about him and me right now.

00:04:57.288 --> 00:04:59.911
I was about to get annoyed.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.920
But Mi Rae,

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.970
you're right about everything.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.244
I know you're a sharp-shooter,

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.955
but sometimes, please,
miss the target a little. Let's go.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.700
Go easy on her.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.422
Even if you miss, everyone
knows you're my best friend.

00:05:20.044 --> 00:05:22.844
Hey, what did I...

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.410
Why did you call me?

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.470
Last night... last night...

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.150
you asked me something weird.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.511
I don't like Seon Ho.

00:05:47.511 --> 00:05:50.933
Why ask that out of nowhere?
It made me feel weird.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.980
No, it's just...

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.680
It's not really something I need to explain,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.911
but since you basically declared
it a fact, got mad and left...

00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:09.333
Did I get mad and leave?

00:06:09.333 --> 00:06:11.155
You seemed mad yesterday.

00:06:11.155 --> 00:06:12.755
Why would I be mad?

00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:15.377
Why should I care who you
like? Why would I be upset?

00:06:15.377 --> 00:06:18.222
I never said you were upset.

00:06:18.222 --> 00:06:21.377
Anyway, I was not mad.

00:06:21.377 --> 00:06:24.044
Then why did you leave without
even saying goodbye yesterday?

00:06:25.066 --> 00:06:27.955
Because... my stomach hurt.

00:06:27.955 --> 00:06:31.450
- Don't you know I have IBS?
- I didn't.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:32.560
Hey, really!

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.810
How could you not know that?

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.100
How did we first meet?

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.377
If I didn't have that condition, would
I ask a random stranger for tissue?

00:06:39.377 --> 00:06:43.610
But if I had that condition,
I would carry tissues around.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.355
That's why I never thought you had IBS.

00:06:46.355 --> 00:06:50.133
Why are you so smart?

00:06:50.977 --> 00:06:54.355
Oh right, you said you're good at studying.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.760
Why are you laughing?

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.111
It's so weird. Why is everything
so easy when I'm with you?

00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:07.377
No matter how serious it is,
it becomes nothing. It's strange.

00:07:11.466 --> 00:07:14.488
- Then, I'm relieved.
- Huh?

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:21.955
Wait, so you don't like Seon Ho?

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:29.536
Yeah, he's just a nice guy.

00:07:30.304 --> 00:07:32.320
Got it.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.360
I can't make it to this week's gathering
because of my part-time job.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.622
You should learn how to lie better, kid.

00:07:56.622 --> 00:07:58.710
Not bad, your lying has improved.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.940
- Was it okay?
- You did well.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.866
But you hesitated for a beat.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:11.511
I was worried you'd say you liked Seon Ho.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.810
Gi Jeong really needs to learn how to lie better.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.066
He said he wasn't mad, but he was totally mad.

00:08:19.066 --> 00:08:21.555
This feels like the right thing to say.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.210
You did well this time.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.070
Of course, being honest and confident is the best,

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.911
but you have to look before you leap.

00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:36.380
If you're honest and confident and end up being
teased about it forever, you might want to die.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.777
Always put yourself first.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.466
Now, go back to how you were.

00:08:45.466 --> 00:08:48.444
Keep Seon Ho as your eternal one-sided love.

00:08:48.444 --> 00:08:50.410
That's better, right?

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:55.288
The excitement, butterflies
and occasional heart-flutters.

Ugh, so frustrating!

I'm doomed.

00:09:18.666 --> 00:09:20.800
This is divine intervention.

How about a beer? Deal?

We still have time before the deadline.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.330
- Hurry up and start again.
- Yeah.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.630

Stay still.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.820
Am I bleeding?

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.111
Luckily, no blood.

00:09:47.111 --> 00:09:49.955
Watch where you're going next time.

Coffee delivery is here.

00:10:20.533 --> 00:10:22.666
This is my junior from
the first year, Kang Ji Won.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.822
I'm Koo Seon Ho, Geu Rin's friend.

00:10:25.822 --> 00:10:29.650
You look even better up close.
Speak casually, please.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.840
Don't even mention it. This kid
has been driving me crazy,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.370
- saying she wants to get close to you.
- True, I made a scene.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.177
She's such a rare, adorable junior.

00:10:38.177 --> 00:10:42.133
Myeong Hun's a great junior too.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.980
I want to be more than a good junior.

00:10:46.888 --> 00:10:49.090
Myeong Hun, listen up.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:50.740
There's no room for 'good men' in my life.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.770
Only good friends, brothers, and juniors.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.960
If you can't keep boundaries, I will. Don't worry.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.340
Wow, you're such a girl crush.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.360
It's not like boundaries are visible.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.650
How can you stick to it perfectly?

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.844
Hey, if I tell you to stick to it,
stick to it. Is this insubordination?

00:11:04.844 --> 00:11:06.888
It's not insubordination,

00:11:06.888 --> 00:11:09.310
it's just... I want to be seen as
a good man rather than a good junior.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:10.311
It's insubordination.

00:11:10.311 --> 00:11:13.860
Rules are meant to be broken,
and promises are meant to be bent.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.960
Why are you talking back?

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.980

00:11:18.266 --> 00:11:19.880
Lines exist to be crossed!

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.822
They exist to be kept.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.044
We'll get going then.

00:11:28.044 --> 00:11:30.530
Geu Rin, we'll get going then.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:36.622
Stop hitting on him! See you tomorrow. Come on.

00:11:36.622 --> 00:11:38.760
Bye.

00:11:39.955 --> 00:11:43.288
You two look good together.

00:11:45.155 --> 00:11:48.210
- Let's go.
- Koo Seon Ho, go home.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.311
If you take me home first,
you have to go all the way back.

00:11:50.311 --> 00:11:54.780
- Go. Don't be weird.
- It's still early. I haven't even had a drink.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:58.533
Only transform into my private jet
when I'm black-out drunk.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.950
Jeez, so awkward.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.380
Don't be so serious. What about my limbs?

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.400
Hey!

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.550
I'm doing this so I'll feel less
sorry to your future wife.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.880
What if I send you to her with worn-out
bones from doing all the work?

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.777
If you can't use your strength when you need to,
I'll become your family's sworn enemy.

00:12:23.866 --> 00:12:26.177
Stop it.

00:12:29.777 --> 00:12:31.377
Bye.

00:12:31.377 --> 00:12:34.980
Oh right, what's this week's concept?

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.622
Bye, my friend Koo Seon Ho. See you tomorrow.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:46.940
What should this week's concept be?

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.220
Suggestions are welcome!

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.244
- The King's Woman.
- Book Club.

00:12:49.244 --> 00:12:50.400
- In Search of a Poet.
- Mental Anguish.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.870
- Here We Go Again.
- Gone With the Wind.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.066
No comments.

00:12:53.066 --> 00:12:55.008
This is fun.

00:12:59.422 --> 00:13:02.590
But why isn't Seon Ho saying anything?

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.377
Why isn't Baeblu saying anything?

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:10.720
I'll just go with whatever's decided.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.340
That's not how it works. Unacceptable.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.330
Let's pick a penalty. This time Baeblu decides.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:19.777
Huh? Me?

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.930
It's Baeblu's turn.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:29.511
Baeblu! Baeblu! Baeblu! Baeblu!

00:13:36.928 --> 00:13:41.422
Hey! Nam Gi Jeong! No input?
Why are you just lurking?

00:13:43.111 --> 00:13:46.177
Gi Jeong isn't saying anything, either.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:58.660
Yes...

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.800
They're practically invisible. So transparent.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.155
What? What's this?

00:14:04.755 --> 00:14:06.933
Wait, I need to focus.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:12.888
Hey, can you talk right now?

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.800
So transparent, right?

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:25.066
- What? Where's he going?
- Nice! Where's he headed?

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.933
- Gi Jeong.
- What? What?

00:14:30.933 --> 00:14:32.540
You saw SF's group chat, right?

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:36.580
The crucial task of deciding
this week's concept fell on me.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.260
What's so important about that?

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.400
Are you entering the Biennale or something?

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.550
Or walking the Academy's red carpet?

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:49.060
Maybe directing a Grammy stage?

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:53.955
It's just that I've never taken
the lead on anything before.

00:14:53.955 --> 00:14:58.533
- Hey, you...
- That's not it. I'm afraid I'll disappoint everyone.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.090
What if everyone hates it?

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.780
What if they pretend to like it when they don't?

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.955
- That would be a nuisance, wouldn't it?
- You dummy.

00:15:05.955 --> 00:15:08.380
How is that a nuisance?

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:12.088
Hey, then just make the concept
'Things That Suck.'

00:15:12.088 --> 00:15:15.040
- Problem solved. The worse, the better.
- Huh?

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.970
Everyone will scramble to come dressed
as the worst thing they can think of.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.850
Look at Green Pig.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.900
Are there any normal people in that group
who would be disappointed?

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.420
- Ah...
- What 'ah'?

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.920
Why are you always so anxious about everything?

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.377
Just go for it. Anything.

00:15:34.355 --> 00:15:36.570
- This is why I called.
- What?

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:39.580
I told you why I wanted to talk.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.577
Talking to you makes everything easier.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.100
I feel stronger talking to you.
There is no logical reason,

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:54.222
but you're a miracle. Thanks.

00:15:54.222 --> 00:15:56.577
You helped me decide what to do.

00:15:57.333 --> 00:16:00.350
Got it. Bye.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:03.288
- Gi Jeong!
- What? What?

00:16:04.222 --> 00:16:06.266
Are you really not mad?

00:16:14.044 --> 00:16:19.022
You don't actually like Seon Ho, right?

00:16:19.955 --> 00:16:23.911
- Shut up.
- No.

00:16:23.911 --> 00:16:28.090
Fine. I'm not mad, either. Bye.

00:16:34.533 --> 00:16:37.511
I finally moved on. Why bring it up again?

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:49.088
- About what? Huh?
- Gosh!

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.430
Who likes Seon Ho?

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.060
Wait, who's Seon Ho?

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.060
Geu Rin's friend,

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.820
from the drawing club.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.190
Him? Who likes him?

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:03.770
Miss Piggy? That Miss Piggy likes him?

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.333
So that's why you're upset?

00:17:07.333 --> 00:17:10.870
My sister. I'm talking about Green Pig.

00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:13.866
Nam Geu Rin likes Seon Ho.

00:17:14.755 --> 00:17:18.060
Okay. That's possible.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.155
But why are you upset?

00:17:22.444 --> 00:17:25.511
I'm her younger brother!

00:17:25.511 --> 00:17:28.460
So, I'd surely feel a little bad,
and it could be that.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.066
Think about it, guys.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:37.511
Do you like Seon Ho? Seriously?

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:40.800
So that's why you were upset.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.800
No! Really! Stop it!

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.511
We're friends! I mean it.

00:17:45.511 --> 00:17:47.333
Don't call us friends!

00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:49.555
Don't come near me!

00:17:52.488 --> 00:17:54.577
My concept is...

00:17:57.288 --> 00:18:00.355
something I've never tried my whole life.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.288
And probably never will.

00:18:05.288 --> 00:18:08.177
Because I'd definitely fail.

00:18:10.444 --> 00:18:17.911
♫ G.O.A.T. G.O.A.T. ♫

00:18:17.911 --> 00:18:22.130
Let's try it once before I die, 'girl crush'.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:25.870
♫ I'm the bottom line ♫

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.644
♫ I'ma make my moves ♫

00:18:27.644 --> 00:18:28.730
♫ Better hurry up ♫

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.650
♫ What you waiting for ♫

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.360
♫ I'm your go-to ♫

00:18:35.466 --> 00:18:38.844
- Baeblu!
- Hello.

00:18:40.444 --> 00:18:44.533
- Ready to transform, Baeblu?
- Yes.

00:18:46.222 --> 00:18:48.577
This is totally U Yeon's style. U Yeon!

00:18:48.577 --> 00:18:50.710
This is so hip. So cool.

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:53.422
- How about this?
- This looks better.

00:19:02.577 --> 00:19:04.480
Not this? What then?

00:19:25.644 --> 00:19:28.740
It's a 'girl crush' concept.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.100
But why does she look cute in everything?

00:19:37.555 --> 00:19:40.400
Wait. Let me try something.

00:19:41.422 --> 00:19:46.130
Ta-da! Looks perfect. Right?

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.930
I've never tried this hairstyle before.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.800
I think it's good.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.090
Wait, there's an outfit I had my eye on. Hold on.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:54.977
I also picked something out.

00:20:11.822 --> 00:20:15.777
To be honest, I've never
really gone shopping properly.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:27.060
- Ta-da! How do I look?
- Hmm, pretty and cute.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:31.130
Even when shopping with friends,
I'd end up empty-handed.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.244
It always ended with me just agreeing with them.

00:20:33.244 --> 00:20:35.890
Song, aren't you buying anything?

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:38.844
You said that was pretty. At least try it on.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.133
Even if I saw clothes I liked...

00:20:46.133 --> 00:20:50.070
No, it probably won't look good on me.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:54.711
So I always bought clothes that
were unnoticeable, just like me.

00:20:57.822 --> 00:20:59.955
Why? Do you like that?

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.060
I just thought it looked nice.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.230
- I've wanted to try this style.
- Then, try it.

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:08.355
You have to try clothes on to know.

00:21:08.355 --> 00:21:12.177
- No, I've never worn clothes like this...
- We'll try this.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:27.480
- Does it look weird?
- No, not at all.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.280
You like it?

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.910
- Yes! Totally.
- Then it's settled.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.210
- Shopping done. She'll wear this.
- Wait a moment.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:40.133
Why? Is there a problem?

00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:42.620
I was wondering if I should
buy something more plain.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.066
I probably won't wear it much anyway.

00:21:45.066 --> 00:21:46.720
Are you from the future?

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.070
Giving up in advance? That's a bad habit.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:53.370
So what? Just wear it once. Let's go!

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.740
Why are you always so anxious about everything?

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.110
Just go for it.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:01.466
Then I'll leave wearing this.

00:22:06.844 --> 00:22:11.030
Wow, look how pretty they are. Are they models?

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:13.470
Whoa, so stunning.

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:17.955
Hey, isn't that the loser girl?

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.333
Huh? No way.

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:26.430
That's great.

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:30.150
If she was alone, I'd totally
shake her down. Forget it.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:31.750
No word from Ahn Ye Rim?

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.288
Is she coming today or not?

00:22:33.288 --> 00:22:37.155
Gosh! I just got a text. She can't make it.

00:22:41.555 --> 00:22:44.768
Jeez, so annoying. She made us wait all this time.

00:22:44.768 --> 00:22:47.420
Okay. Next pose.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.111
Let's try crossing arms gently.

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:55.750
Let's take a short break.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.580
We barely shot anything! Break already?

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.130
Let's just power through.

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:00.420
- Faster.
- Just a short break.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:02.666
Ye Rim isn't even complaining.

00:23:02.666 --> 00:23:04.220
It's hot. Let's rest for five minutes. Seriously.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.688
Hey, the boss is talking here.

00:23:06.688 --> 00:23:09.020
Aren't you coming? Coming or not?

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.820
I'll go drag him here.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.730
Let's just rest for five more minutes.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:14.390
We've got plenty of time.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:18.044
Fine. Let's rest.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.900
[Oh! You met U Yeon?]

00:23:35.511 --> 00:23:38.622
Man, this weather's insane.

00:23:42.304 --> 00:23:47.244
- Why no progress in your crush?
- Stop it.

00:23:47.244 --> 00:23:50.533
- Siblings fighting over one guy?
- Ridiculous.

00:23:50.533 --> 00:23:52.720
- My heart aches.
- Aches indeed.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.422
- This is boring.
- It's fun! Really!

00:23:55.422 --> 00:23:58.220
But you know, Seon Ho and Geu Rin
have been close for a long time.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.800
They've been friends since middle school.

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.000
Where do you fit between them?

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
You haven't confessed yet, right?

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.280
Don't confess! Just don't. Please.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:16.088
If you do that and get rejected hard, you'll be
banging your head in the closet again screaming.

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.288
- Did you actually confess?
- Jeez, you scared me.

00:24:22.755 --> 00:24:25.866
Are you going to keep doing
this? It's not even funny.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.910
What's not fun?

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:31.377
Gi Jeong likes some guy.

00:24:32.888 --> 00:24:35.822
- Tae Seon, Dae O, come here.
- Yes?

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:47.540
Is your phone broken?

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:52.360
No. Stop sending me selfies.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.550
Because you're not replying.

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:57.210
I keep asking if I look good, and you ignore me.

00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:59.920
- Why won't you reply?
- Why are you asking me that?

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.177
You'd know if you looked in the mirror.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.577
I want to hear it from you, that's all.

00:25:10.266 --> 00:25:14.711
- How many outfits left?
- Five. Why?

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.155
I'll finish them in thirty minutes.

00:25:19.155 --> 00:25:22.810
You'll finish? Oh wow, Mr. Hotshot
here. Who do you think you are?

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:23.950
I'll do as instructed.

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:26.380
Whether it's linking arms or putting
an arm around the shoulder, I'll do it all.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:29.830
I can even do a pose that's
stronger than what you want.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.444
Nice! Next pose!

00:25:34.304 --> 00:25:36.512
Okay.

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:41.866
Oh, this works.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:47.644
Good. More! Just a bit more.

00:25:49.911 --> 00:25:51.540
Okay, got it!

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.133
Got the shot. We're wrapping up.

00:25:54.133 --> 00:25:56.940
Done? Are we finished? Bye.

00:25:57.644 --> 00:26:00.330
- Hey! Change first.
- I'm late.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:02.355
Hey, where are you going?

00:26:03.511 --> 00:26:05.511
What's the rush?

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:23.240
Pretty. The pink hairpiece makes it perfect.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.200
Really?

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.896
We're done here. We'll go ahead.

00:26:28.896 --> 00:26:31.288
We'll go finish up.

00:26:37.066 --> 00:26:39.650
♫ You've waited so long, I'm late ♫

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:44.540
♫ I'm sorry, I'm new to this, didn't know ♫

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:47.777
♫ Just because it's you, just because I like you ♫

00:26:47.777 --> 00:26:52.790
♫ Words can't express it ♫

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:53.800
Nam Gi Jeong?

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.355
♫ There's no other way ♫

00:26:57.422 --> 00:26:59.555
You said you couldn't come today
because of your part-time job.

00:27:01.866 --> 00:27:05.170
♫ I've captured it all here ♫

00:27:14.088 --> 00:27:15.911
It ended earlier.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
The 'screwed' concept, how is it?

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
The 'things that suck' concept.

00:27:20.622 --> 00:27:23.680
What kind of 'things that suck' concept is this?

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:28.800
What's more 'sucky' for me than 'girl crush'?
How is it? Full of concept, right?

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:34.577
- I don't know.
- You came? I thought you couldn't make it.

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:40.000
Why is that guy coming down from there again?

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
- Hello.
- Doesn't U Yeon and I have similar vibes today?

00:27:45.022 --> 00:27:46.800
It looks good on you.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.280
Really? The girls helped me get ready.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.260
Let's go, Miss Piggy.

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:53.370
Let's go, huh?

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:57.688
Where? Is it here today? Here?

00:27:57.688 --> 00:27:59.620
Oh, it's here.

00:28:02.208 --> 00:28:03.555
Why are you annoyed?

00:28:03.555 --> 00:28:06.088
It actually suits her surprisingly well.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.700
Who does it suit?

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:11.911
You should make some noise when you move around.

00:28:12.844 --> 00:28:15.670
How do I look today? Isn't it amazing?

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:18.910
Wow, it's really amazing.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.220
Put this on.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.370
Hey! What are you doing?
This is part of the concept.

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:40.577
You'll catch a cold. Give it to me
when we're working later.

00:28:52.133 --> 00:28:53.955
Looks like you're getting hit again today.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.644
Alright, shall we begin?

00:29:06.666 --> 00:29:08.755
Hey! Move aside.

00:29:08.755 --> 00:29:10.470
This is my spot, okay?

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:12.320
Out. Get out.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.260
Hey, I saved this spot with my sketchbook.

00:29:38.177 --> 00:29:40.960
♫ You're shining brightly ♫

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:47.460
♫ Like a star lighting up my heart ♫

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:52.622
♫ With your own light, your own colors ♫

00:29:52.622 --> 00:29:59.520
♫ Filling the whole world
and my dreams with beauty ♫

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:10.933
My pencil is broken.

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.860
Pass me a pencil.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:17.190
Hey, I'm using this.

00:30:22.577 --> 00:30:24.640
Okay, one minute left.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.490
This one is a masterpiece. A masterpiece!

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:32.044
I loved the cosplay theme.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.088
Look, look!

00:30:36.088 --> 00:30:38.350
But where is Baeblu's drawing?

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.111
Why are you like this?

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.860
Let me see.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.950
I really messed up drawing this.

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:53.030
It's okay. It's okay.

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:54.350
No, it's not okay.

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:59.955
It's only been a short time, of course.
Plus I told you it doesn't matter if it's bad.

00:31:10.144 --> 00:31:12.000
Is this me?

00:31:12.755 --> 00:31:14.666
What's wrong with you, Green Pig?

00:31:14.666 --> 00:31:17.410
You need to be re-educated!

00:31:26.977 --> 00:31:32.888
Listen up, Baeblu. Confidence
matters more than skill. Got it?

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.240
Let's go.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.844
Gather around.

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:42.400
- It's enough.
- Okay, stop.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.377
Let me see.

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.777
The lines have such energy.

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:58.500
Hmm, you're surprisingly a power-type.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:02.190
- You're 'gentle on the outside, strong on the inside'?
- What did you say?

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:03.190
The sense of proportion is good.

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:06.830
It's really amazing for someone
who hasn't been doing it long.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:09.440
Your chaotic inner self is expressed perfectly.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:12.090
As expected of the stormy period of adolescence.

00:32:13.111 --> 00:32:15.822
- Stormy, stormy...
- You're going to be great.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.720
There's no way...

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.980
There's just no way. No, really,

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:24.622
what's wrong with everyone's eyes?
What about this... where?

00:32:24.622 --> 00:32:26.888
It's hard to even draw like this
when it's your first time.

00:32:26.888 --> 00:32:30.222
It's good. It's good for a first time.

00:32:30.222 --> 00:32:32.880
You still haven't been hit
enough! You! Get back here!

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.410
What's your problem, Green Pig?

00:32:42.222 --> 00:32:44.133
Geu Rin is right.

00:32:46.311 --> 00:32:48.020
That's good for your level, Baeblu.

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.740
I couldn't even draw a single line for a month.

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.540
Should I show you?

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:01.422
Ah, here.

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:07.000
And today...

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.820
Today, you even colored?

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:13.155
- I had 2 seconds left, so I tried coloring.
- Coloring?

00:33:16.355 --> 00:33:17.920
I still think my strokes are too light.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.533
Still better than me.

00:33:22.266 --> 00:33:26.340
Yeah, I can't even finish mine.
I always leave off an arm or a leg.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:29.610
But you're really good at drawing faces.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:33.380
I find drawing faces really fun.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:37.090
Look. Especially the expressions.
They're all different, right?

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:42.730
If I look at them closely, I get really
focused, and... it's just so much fun.

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:46.760
So, Khaki, take off that hat sometimes.

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.620
Right, let's see your face.

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:53.111
Everyone really loves drawing.

00:33:54.088 --> 00:33:56.710
Hey, is this you?

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:58.430
You said this was a group for people who draw.

00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:59.822
What is this?

00:33:59.822 --> 00:34:07.155
How could they laugh at a drawing
someone worked so hard on? That's the worst.

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:10.711
It's no different from that jerk.

00:34:10.711 --> 00:34:14.533
Okay, let's finish with a couple
pose. Who wants to do it?

00:34:14.533 --> 00:34:19.970
How about U Yeon and Seon Ho today?
They're wearing couple outfits.

00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:22.933
- Oh, fresh idea.
- Sounds good.

00:34:22.933 --> 00:34:26.622
- Then, shall we?
- Yeah! Do it.

00:34:30.177 --> 00:34:32.032
U Yeon.

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.820
I'll do it.

00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:55.250
I'll do the couple pose with Miss Piggy.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:35:00.800
- Lend me your jacket.
- Gi Jeong would look better in it anyway.

00:35:26.488 --> 00:35:28.910
Can that even be called a pose?

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:30.888
Hey, Nam Gi Jeong, step up your game.

00:35:30.888 --> 00:35:32.533
How can I work with such a stiff model?

00:35:32.533 --> 00:35:35.380
- What more can I do?
- Exactly, U Yeon.

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:40.355
- Try being more natural, okay?
- Got it.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.040
Another masterpiece today!

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:39.820
Gi Jeong is a real model.

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.950
You and U Yeon don't look good together.

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:43.950
Nah, I like this one the best.

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:44.980
I'm going to the bathroom.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:47.860
The rediscovery of manly-man in Brown.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.760
Most people don't realize this,

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.288
but I'm actually the manly man of this era.

00:36:53.288 --> 00:36:57.460
Then I'm a total 'girl crush'.

00:36:58.888 --> 00:37:01.555
I've been called 'girl crush' a few times.

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.466
I know Geu Rin well.

00:37:05.466 --> 00:37:07.911
What do you know, punk?

00:37:09.288 --> 00:37:11.040
Obviously.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:17.230
- Well...
- Let Geu Rin explain.

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:20.560
Do you remember any 'manly man'
moments from Seon Ho?

00:37:22.088 --> 00:37:26.500
Nope. Koo Seon Ho has never been tough.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:30.970
Black Finger is a 'girl crush' every single day.

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:34.360
Well... Where did Poo-Gi go?

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:38.270
- That jerk.
- Clueless as usual.

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.260
What's wrong?

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.550
Are you mad because you
couldn't pose with Seon Ho?

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:07.680
- What should I say?
- What?

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:10.755
Why did you come today?
You said you weren't coming.

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:17.377
I said I don't like Seon Ho.

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:20.755
But you couldn't trust me,
so you came to watch me?

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.260
Just answer one thing.

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:30.280
Why can't I like Seon Ho?

00:38:31.822 --> 00:38:34.755
- Who said you can't--
- Stop lying.

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:40.311
I know why you're mad I like Seon Ho.

00:38:41.288 --> 00:38:45.066
You fear I'll sabotage
his relationship with Geu Rin.

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.355
Why would I interfere?

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:51.644
How could I come between them?

00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:54.340
I'm not stupid.

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:57.911
I know better than anyone how perfect they are.

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:03.111
Did you run here because you
were afraid I'd confess?

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.022
How could I do that?

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:14.310
I know perfectly well that if I confess,
I won't even be able to just watch him from afar.

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:19.320
Why would I do something so stupid?

00:39:24.933 --> 00:39:30.710
So, Gi Jeong, stop monitoring me.

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:34.488
I don't matter as much as your sister does.

00:39:34.488 --> 00:39:37.866
Why would I walk down a path
where I'll obviously get hurt?

00:39:44.044 --> 00:39:48.933
Fine, I like Seon Ho.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:54.810
But I'll keep it to myself.

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:56.720
Who I like is my business.

00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:00.800
So, stop meddling with my business.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.760
[Geu Rin: You and Poo Gi Jeong, looking so good
it is annoying. Here's the picture, try to draw it]

00:41:00.222 --> 00:41:02.444
- Were you spacing out again?
- Huh?

00:41:02.444 --> 00:41:05.333
It's open to the same page you were on early.

00:41:05.333 --> 00:41:07.422
What's wrong with you?

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.155
Whatever.

00:41:14.133 --> 00:41:19.555
How many days have you been stuck on this
chapter? Your brother finished it in 2 days.

00:41:19.555 --> 00:41:23.270
You said you could study on your own,
so I even canceled the study room.

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:25.111
Should I hire a tutor again?

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:29.090
No, I can do it myself.

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:31.610
My score went up a little on the last test.

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:35.333
You call that improvement?

00:41:42.933 --> 00:41:44.830
Should I just give up on you?

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:46.711
Would that be better?

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:50.850
Finish all of this before you sleep.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:09.866
Why did you come today?

00:42:10.488 --> 00:42:12.704
You said you weren't coming.

00:42:12.704 --> 00:42:14.592
Exactly.

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:17.370
I don't know, either.

00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:22.622
I said I don't like Seon Ho.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:27.450
- But you couldn't trust me, so you came to watch me?
- No.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:33.810
- I know why you're mad I like Seon Ho.
- Right.

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:35.510
Say something.

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:37.250
Why am I even mad?

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.850
You fear I'll sabotage
his relationship with Geu Rin.

00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:41.140
That's not it.

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:45.822
Why would I interfere? How
could I come between them?

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:50.488
Just answer one thing.

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:04.577
Why can't I like Seon Ho? Answer.

00:43:08.133 --> 00:43:10.500
Answer me.

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.320
Why not?

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:32.864
In front of the Gallery by 5:30.
I'll wait even if you don't come.

00:43:32.864 --> 00:43:40.864
[Arsehole]

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.133
Hello?

00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:46.711
Yeah, I'm not going.

00:43:52.266 --> 00:43:54.240
Don't need--

00:44:20.888 --> 00:44:26.570
The client you are trying to reach
can't answer the phone right now.

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:29.111
What's up with Nam Gi Jeong?

00:44:32.222 --> 00:44:34.112
U Yeon.

00:44:37.911 --> 00:44:40.920
- You're on time!
- Huh?

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.844
Gi Jeong is sick.

00:44:42.844 --> 00:44:47.022
He suddenly insisted on going to a gallery,
and then said he was sick and sent you instead.

00:44:47.022 --> 00:44:48.940
Isn't that why you're here?

00:44:51.517 --> 00:44:53.415
It's Gi Jeong.

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:58.190
Hey, Gi Jeong. You didn't tell U Yeon?

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:01.422
Okay. Got it. Just a sec.

00:45:09.644 --> 00:45:13.790
- Yeah.
- Seon Ho loves small galleries.

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:16.577
Green Pig and Seon Ho aren't dating.

00:45:16.577 --> 00:45:19.330
They're just buddies.

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:21.890
I've seen them for years.

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:23.490
Don't worry.

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:27.422
Instead of worrying, just stop
liking him only in your heart.

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:32.311
And I'm sorry about yesterday.

00:45:36.711 --> 00:45:40.930
Ah! And you are pretty good at lying.

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:45.920
Didn't you say talking to me simplifies things?

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:47.610
But even when we were together yesterday,

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:50.488
you were overthinking
and seemed conflicted, right?

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:56.440
Ask Seon Ho to buy you something tasty.

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.600
- Stand up straight.
- Huh?

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:10.000
- Did the call go well?
- Yes.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.900
Shall we go in, then?

00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:01.377
- Did you have fun?
- Yes.

00:47:03.555 --> 00:47:05.900
Why? Was it not fun?

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:08.266
No, it was fun.

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:13.777
- Well, Seon Ho.
- Yes?

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:17.733
There's something I want to ask you.

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:24.160
Wait. Na Na?

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:29.370
Hey, Geu Rin is drunk again. Come
get her before it gets cold tonight.

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:30.370
Keep holding onto her. I'm coming now.

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:31.890
Keep holding onto her.

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:34.711
I need to rush there.

00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:37.970
Sorry, U Yeon, I have to go.

00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:40.266
Looks like Geu Rin has passed out again.

00:47:41.824 --> 00:47:44.890
- Okay. Go check on her.
- Sorry.

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:46.711
Gi Jeong insisted that I treat you to a meal.

00:47:46.711 --> 00:47:50.430
No need. Don't worry about me.

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:52.444
Then, I'll see you at the club meeting.

00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:02.533
U Yeon, it will get colder.

00:48:02.533 --> 00:48:04.830
Give it to me later.

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:06.060
No, it's okay.

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:07.290
I can just go.

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:09.850
This way I'll feel better about it.

00:48:19.466 --> 00:48:22.133
I'm leaving. Get home safe.

00:48:28.711 --> 00:48:30.533
Blue Finger is an amazing person.

00:48:30.533 --> 00:48:34.266
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:48:34.266 --> 00:48:38.860
Sorry, do you have a moment?

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:41.333
Someone who noticed
someone like me at first sight.

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:46.630
- This size is perfect. How is it?
- Good.

00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:50.977
The person who brought me into a new world.

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:56.560
It's natural for amazing people
to like amazing people.

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:28.350
My heart, which dared to like a cool
person... That's right. It's my heart.

00:49:28.350 --> 00:49:29.950
I told you not to call Koo Seon Ho.

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:34.350
- I didn't mean for you to dump me on just anyone.
- 'Just anyone'?

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:35.640
Am I 'just anyone' to you?

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:39.170
I'm just giving you a ride.
You won't even allow that?

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:41.960
My private jet isn't coming anyway.

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:47.530
- I'll just walk alone.
- Geu Rin.

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:51.030
This won't do. I'll get you a hangover remedy.

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:52.864
Wait right here.

00:49:55.066 --> 00:49:57.822
Bring Na Na over.

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:02.650
Ugh, I'm so tired.

00:50:09.111 --> 00:50:11.230
He said he doesn't like me because I'm fat.

00:50:12.311 --> 00:50:15.422
Don't mind him. Just leave me alone.

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.520
I'm going to lose weight.

00:51:07.155 --> 00:51:09.111
You're getting better at this.

00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:12.888
You knew I was following you, yet stay silent?

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:18.666
This feeling of receiving
a favor, it's kind of nice.

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.390
What's wrong with Seon Ho?

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:25.490
Why did he just leave?

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:28.266
I specifically told him to treat you to a meal.

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:37.066
- You really...
- Why?

00:51:38.266 --> 00:51:43.644
I don't know how you got mixed up in this,

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.355
but you don't have to worry about me anymore.

00:51:48.088 --> 00:51:50.590
About getting mad at you yesterday...

00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:54.222
It wasn't your fault. It was mine.

00:51:55.866 --> 00:52:02.533
Some days I feel like a 10 won
coin rolling on the ground.

00:52:03.555 --> 00:52:08.088
- A 10 won coin?
- Yes. Would you pick it up?

00:52:08.088 --> 00:52:10.390
- No.
- See?

00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:12.080
No one picks it up.

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.690
Ten won is still money, yet no one cares.

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:16.760
It's considered useless.

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:18.622
Want to hear something funny?

00:52:18.622 --> 00:52:21.020
Since I'm a teen, maybe 10 won is okay.

00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:25.850
The rhyme works, teen and 10 won.
But later, in your 20s, 30s, 40s,

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:29.200
what if I'm still a 10 won coin growing old?

00:52:29.822 --> 00:52:32.290
- Have you ever thought about that?
- No.

00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:36.133
Never. My boss calls me a blank check.

00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:41.688
As expected, Nam Gi Jeong makes it easy.

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:50.920
Didn't you know that?

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:57.866
- You are pretty.
- What?

00:52:58.577 --> 00:53:02.311
In my eyes, you look beautiful right now.

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:11.333
- U Dol, it's Mom. What?
- What should I do?

00:53:11.333 --> 00:53:13.644
Your sister still isn't home?

00:53:13.644 --> 00:53:16.666
- What's wrong?
- It's my mom. Hide!

00:53:20.888 --> 00:53:23.155
No signs she came and left?

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.177
Do you know what time it is? Why isn't she home?

00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:37.377
Ah! Gosh! I thought we were caught.

00:54:01.111 --> 00:54:02.977
Ah, I'll go.

00:54:08.488 --> 00:54:10.336
Now I get it.

00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:13.244
The reason I was upset.

00:54:15.466 --> 00:54:20.130
You should like me.

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:25.111
Not Seon Ho.

00:54:39.377 --> 00:54:41.390
- No.
- I'll just die.

00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:45.777
They found you. New world ahead.
I should block his ass.

00:54:45.777 --> 00:54:47.280
The godfather's an ace member of SF.

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:48.933
Your male friend Seon Ho.

00:54:48.933 --> 00:54:51.688
- I won't date you.
- I don't want to be friends.

00:54:51.688 --> 00:54:53.155
Don't I deserve that much responsibility?

00:54:53.155 --> 00:54:56.310
- You have to put precious things in a ring.
- I heard there's a slow kid in your class.

00:54:56.310 --> 00:54:57.500
Me too.

00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:00.540
- Even my friend is that handsome. Ah, darn...
- That guy is cool.

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:02.280
Why do that?

00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:03.900
- They look good together.
- They look really good, right?

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:06.200
I'll save up some skinship for later, too.

00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:08.560
Let's get married!

00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:18.170
That's so like you.

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:21.310
- Shouldn't you be studying instead?
- No, I--

00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:24.110
I was just taking a short break.

00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:28.030
- You fall for it every time.
- That's so you. Shouldn't you be studying instead?

00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:29.900
Who said you could just
come into my room? Get out!

00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:31.910
- What's 7 multiplied by 8?
- 56.

00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:35.590
- What's 12 multiplied by 4?
- 48.

00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:38.133
What's 345 multiplied by 512?

00:55:38.133 --> 00:55:39.960
It's 176,640.

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:41.330
You don't even know that?

00:55:41.330 --> 00:55:44.380
Ah, I'm tired from playing with an idiot.
