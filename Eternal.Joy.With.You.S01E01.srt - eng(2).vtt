=Eternal Joy With You=
=Episode 1=

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.750
Congratulations!

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.070
This way, please. This way.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.550
(Marquis's Mansion)
Long time no see.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.750
(Today is a joyous day for our family.)

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.770
(Ping has passed the exam
and becomes a scholar.)

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.430
(Lady Cui has been honored
with a title.)

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.780
(My husband)

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.330
(Cui Yunfeng, the Cui's eldest son)
(will rise to great heights.)

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.470
(And I, the Madam of the household,)

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.100
(Xu Wanning)
(after my assets were drained by them,)

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.680
(The Madam)
(was cast aside like trash,)

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.280
(being left to rot
in this foul dungeon.)

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.840
Commander Pei Heng of the Jinlin Guards
has arrived.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.790
Summon Marquis Cui and Madam Xu
to receive the decree.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.300
(Pei Heng, Commander of Jinlin Guards)

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.500
I apologize for my tardiness.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.630
Please forgive me, Commander.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.840
Are you Marquis Cui and Madam Xu?

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.640
My wife is bedridden
unable to receive the decree.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.640
My Lady.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.910
My Lady.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.150
Hongmei,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.840
I painstakingly managed the household
for 12 years;

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.150
in the end,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.150
both my husband and the position
all belong to someone else.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.790
Even the child I raised for 12 years
is not mine.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.870
My life has been wasted.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.710
My Lady,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.990
Commander Pei Heng of the Jinlin Guards
is right outside.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.340
You must pull yourself together.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.130
(Hongmei, the Xu's maid)
This is your chance.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.790
We can't let the young master
die in vain.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.840
Thanks for coming all this way,
Commander.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.630
Why not stay and have a cup of wine?

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.680
My Lady, the Commander is just ahead.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.520
Let me see you out.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.120
Continue the music.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.960
Commander.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.280
Commander.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.090
Commander.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.310
Commander.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.400
Commander.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.630
Commander.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.140
Commander, I'm the wife of Marquis Cui.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.910
Let me go.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.150
Commander.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.470
My Lady!

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.080
(You vile people,)

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.000
(you schemed for my wealth,
deceived my trust,)

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.430
(tarnished my honor
and killed my child.)

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.000
(I am filled with hatred.)

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.240
(If I could live again,)

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.280
(I would ensure your family
loses all its wealth,)

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.360
(abandons your sincerity,)

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.910
(destroys your reputation,
suffers the pain of loss,)

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.870
(and pays the price in blood.)

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.400
(What is happening to me?)

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.280
(Shouldn't I be dead?)

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.960
(My face...)

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.150
(Why is the scar gone?)

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.150
Hongmei.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.840
It was clearly you
who stole the Madam's dowry money.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.190
Admit your guilt!

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:36.590
It wasn't me.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.590
I didn't take it.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.840
I didn't take the money.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.240
(Cui Yunfeng?)

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.000
(Hongmei...)

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.560
(Hongmei is also alive.)

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.540
(Cui Yunfeng stole my dowry)

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.350
(and used it to buy a house
for his mistress.)

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.750
(After I found the deed,
he framed Hongmei.)

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.430
You wretched servant!

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.800
How dare you steal
the Madam's dowry money!

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.960
Yunfeng, it must be a misunderstanding.
Hongmei wouldn't do that.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.590
Take action!

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.680
My Lady, please believe me.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.990
(The Official Deed)
(This deed harmed Hongmei back then.)

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.750
(This is)

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.710
(six years ago.)

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.280
Since you refuse to admit it,

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.710
I'll have to enforce the punishment.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:17.870
Wait!

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.240
I'd like to see who dares!

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:24.710
Wanning,

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.830
the household affairs are complicated.
We agreed I'd handle them.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.650
You should just relax
and enjoy yourself.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.720
I know where the silver is kept.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.350
Where?

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.190
Have you forgotten?
We purchased a property.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Just a moment.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.720
This is the deed. Don't you remember?

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.560
How do you know...

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.040
(Just as I thought.)

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.750
(I've returned to six years ago.)

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.430
I am your wife.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.950
You told me yourself.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.270
I...

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.350
How could I?

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.480
Get up first.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.920
Have you forgotten, Yunfeng?

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.720
You told me in your dream.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.560
In the dream?

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.910
Yeah.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.310
Then did I mention in the dream

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.190
what I intended to do
with this property?

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.070
It seems you didn't mention that.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.390
You just said you want
to acquire a property

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.680
and then entrust the remaining money

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.870
to me to manage.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.390
You can't remember anything?

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.800
Then let's do this.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.600
Let's take a stroll inside.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.360
Perhaps it will jog your memory.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.320
No need.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.550
Let's follow what was said in the dream.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.240
Yes, the dowry money.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.120
Thank you, Yunfeng.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.430
My Lady, this is wonderful.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.390
Hongmei, don't worry.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.830
Now that I've returned,

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.830
I won't let the Cui Family
bully us anymore.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.680
My Lady,

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.950
you seem a bit different today
than before.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.360
(I won't let myself be trampled on
like in my past life.)

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.940
(Marquis's Mansion in Yan City)

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.870
Wanning, I heard Ping needs money
for his studies.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.240
Let's use your dowry for it first.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.000
After all, Ping's education
is the most important.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.510
Mother, it's natural.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.000
She surely understands this.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.870
And she cares for Ping the most, right?

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.600
You are his birth mother, after all.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.040
Ping,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.630
please save me, Ping!

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.190
You ugly woman,

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.600
I can't stand the sight of you.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.080
Ping,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.490
you contracted Corpse Blossom Rash
when you were six years old.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.040
I took care of you with all my heart.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.430
You recovered, but I caught the illness.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.480
That's why I look like this now.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.480
Even so,

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.070
how could you reject your own mother?

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.000
I would never reject my mother.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.510
She is the best person to me
in this world,

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:16.680
and also the most beautiful.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.670
Good boy.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.070
Mother, let's go quickly.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.800
Why are you calling Mother?

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.390
Why are you calling her Mother?

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.910
Foolish woman.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.000
Ping is the biological son
of the Marquis and me.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.950
Sure. Education is the top priority.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.830
But Ping is the heir of the Cui Family.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.160
If the expenses keep coming
from my family's accounts,

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.950
people might gossip
about the Cui Family.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.430
Gossip?

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.480
They said Ping is neglected
in the family;

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.160
he doesn't act like a legitimate son,
more like an illegitimate one.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.830
Nonsense! Ping is the legitimate heir
of our family.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.300
Isn't it just about hiring a tutor?

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.480
If you're unwilling,
there's no need to speak more.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.270
Feng, take it from my account.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.680
Yes, Mother.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.480
(Cui Yunfeng is still the spineless one
who obeys his mother.)

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.360
(And Lady Cui still cares most
about reputation.)

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.680
Just wait and see.
The fortune of the Cui Family

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:26.430
will begin its decline from today.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.950
(My child, I was incompetent
in my past life,)

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.450
(causing you to die unjustly.)

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:38.720
(In this life, I will find you
and protect you.)

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:54.360
(The Corpse Blossom Rash
was actually man-made.)

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.510
No wonder

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.790
you always kept Cui Qingping
away from my courtyard.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.750
It turns out this sachet
was a hidden trap.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:05.920
(I wonder when this sachet was hung)

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.010
(and whether the poison
has already entered my body.)

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.960
(Just in case,
I must prepare the antidote.)

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:12.960
(Yes, Guiku Herb.)

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.000
Sir, is everything I asked for ready?

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.120
It's all here. I'm wrapping it up now.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:19.970
Hmm.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Go to the back gate
of the Marquis's Mansion

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.900
and hand it to Hongmei.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.120
Madam, rest assured.
I'll follow your instructions.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.240
I won't alert the Marquis, no worries.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.080
Thank you, sir.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.870
It's OK.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.030
Take care, Madam.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.600
Commander, His Majesty has ordered you
to investigate Hongzhen Incense.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.000
Guiku Herb is a key ingredient.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.830
I found out this pharmacy
is hoarding large quantities

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.470
of Guiku Herb.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.240
But the shopkeeper seems quite simple.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.880
He doesn't seem to be breaking the law.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.700
(Baicao Pharmacy)

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:51.270
Rather kill by mistake

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.800
than let go.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.990
Yes.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.360
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.660
Why so much Guiku Herb?

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.410
What's it for?

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.670
Get out of here! Who are you?

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:03.750
Mind your own business.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:05.670
You...

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.570
Speak.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.150
Or I'll burn your shop down.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.990
I'll talk, I'll talk.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.750
The Madam from the Cui Family
ordered it.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.150
She said it was
for the young master's cough.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.120
The Cui Family, Cui Yunfeng?

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.110
Exactly.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.360
Besides him,

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.120
has anyone else bought this herb?

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.150
Let me think for a moment.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.200
Ah, yes.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.510
There was also a young lady.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.840
She had bought quite a few.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.960
(Bai Qingqing,)

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.200
(you and Cui Yunfeng schemed
meticulously)

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.550
(to poison my scented sachet,)

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.790
(causing me and everyone in my courtyard
to contract the Corpse Blossom Rash.)

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.200
(Now I will return all of these to you.)

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.270
(Commander Pei Heng
of the Jinlin Guards?)

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:36.960
(Why is this fiend here?)

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.720
(In my past life, he and Bai Qingqing
had no connection.)

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.790
(How could this be?)
