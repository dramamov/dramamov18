starting today.)

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.690
We're not open.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.540
I'm looking for Lyu Danshun.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.420
(Police)

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.820
We're here

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.890
to ask you a few questions.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.060
I'm grabbing a quick bite.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.000
Call me if you need me.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.340
This is about Hong again, right?

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.090
You keep asking me the same thing.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.090
I really don't know.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.290
Danshun.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.730
Aside from Qin Hong's mother,

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.340
you're the only one in her world

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.220
who can be called family.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.780
We were just childhood neighbors.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.780
Not actual siblings.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.900
Danshun.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.060
I know

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.940
I've asked you this question
so many times.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.100
Tell me the truth.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.220
After the murder,

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.940
- did she reach out to you?
- No.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.170
After Kaifu died,

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.340
she never contacted me again.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.850
Maybe she had planned
to kill Huang Shuquan,

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.340
so she stayed away from me,

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.890
not wanting to drag me into it.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.500
After she did it,

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.320
how could she possibly tell me
where she was?

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:28.570
Danshun,

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.170
I'm not sure if you know

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.500
my bond with Kaifu.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:35.890
No matter how far

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.660
Qin Hong runs,

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.010
no matter how well she hides,

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.500
she'll be caught one day.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.780
I'm helping her right now.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.850
Have you figured out Kaifu's case?

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.780
After Huang Shuquan died,

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.450
Zhao Chen, the driver,

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.780
confessed that Huang Shuquan

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.780
had ordered him to kill Kaifu.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.610
The police have arrested

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.450
Huang Shuquan's gang in one sweep.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.730
But it was too late.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.170
Officer Liu, I really can't help you.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.100
What are you planning to do
without the store?

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.490
Not sure yet.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.860
Maybe I'll head south to find work.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.210
Alright then.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.050
If you ever need help,

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.460
just reach out to me anytime.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.740
Okay.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.260

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.700
(2013/12/17, Tuesday)

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.610
This video was from the surveillance

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.730
of the Gaoqi Transit Station
in the Pingtan suburbs.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.410
Lyu Danshun and Qin Hong
jumped off the truck here

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.610
and then moved into a blind spot.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.410
According to our investigation,

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.780
the truck came from Chang'an Town.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.280
So, they most likely slipped out

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.730
through the mountain roads

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.850
after we locked down the town.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.050
Lyu Danshun said

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.410
he used to work in Pingtan.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.170
Qin Hong was once in Pingtan, too.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.540
We now suspect those two

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.890
have contacted each other earlier.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.730
Then why did they go back to Pingtan?

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.410
That's still unclear for now.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.490
But we've sent people

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.900
to track them down in Pingtan.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.780
Who's that kid in the video?

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:02.700
(2013/12/17, Tuesday)

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.610
Her name is Chen Yiting.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.440
We did some digging.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.490
Her parents are divorced.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:07.850
Her mother's name is Zhang Yan.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.100
Her father is Chen Tonghe.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.540
Lyu Danshun claimed Zhang Yan
was his girlfriend.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.980
I went back to Chencang
to meet Qin Hong's mother.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.980
At her elderly home,

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.390
I found a transferred sum of money.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.100
The sender's name on it was Zhang Yan.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.660
It seems

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.100
Qin Hong wired the money

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.220
under Zhang Yan's name.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.710
As for Zhang Yan herself,

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.590
we haven't been able to reach her.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.410
But her household registration is
in Shimen under Pingtan.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.930
Chief Liu and I will head there soon.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.660
There are too many loose ends
in Ma Weicheng's case.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.730
Qin Hong isn't even dead,

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.780
and now we have Lyu Danshun

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.410
and Zhang Yan.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.730
We need to figure out the connections

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.680
between these people first.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.000
After Qin Hong committed the murder

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.220
and disappeared from Chencang,

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.410
we looked into Lyu Danshun.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.390
There was no sign of suspicion on him.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.380
We also didn't find any evidence

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.250
of his contact with Qin Hong.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.290
Later, the tattoo store where he worked

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.220
was demolished,

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.540
so he went south to find work.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.220
So, Lyu Danshun has been lying.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.290
He actually stayed in contact
with Qin Hong

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:13.290
and even helped her out.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.980
I suspected he was lying that day.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.750
Later, we found out

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.540
that on the night
Huang Shuquan was killed,

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.980
he carried a suitcase
with 600,000 in cash.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.660
But at the crime scene,

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.150
that suitcase was nowhere to be found.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.080
Back then, we suspected

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.390
that Qin Hong had left with the money.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.780
But later, we reconsidered.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.340
It'd be strange for Qin Hong

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.980
to carry that much cash around.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.100
What about Lyu Danshun?

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.540
Maybe he brought the money to Pingtan

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.540
and met up with Qin Hong here.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.780
It's not some decent job.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.290
But the pay was good.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.410
Earlier, we suspected

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.730
that Qin Hong used
Zhang Yan's identity to transfer money.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.660
But Zhang Yan's child, Chen Yiting,

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.410
was with Qin Hong and Lyu Danshun.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.900
That proves Zhang Yan
had ties with them.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.660
It wasn't just about a stolen identity.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.490
But where is Zhang Yan now?

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:18.060
(Hongben Inn)

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.700
Mengmeng's probably been exhausted.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.340
She fell asleep.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.730
How do we get in touch with them?

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.340
(Feichuan)

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.220
It's too risky. Let me go.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.100
This thing started because of me.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.090
I'll go.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:42.220
Hello.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.220
Do you know where Zhang Yan lives?

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.490
Go straight ahead.

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:47.330
Straight ahead?

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.490
Thanks.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:49.450
Thank you.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:18.330
Ma'am.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:20.940
Ma'am?

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.340
Who are you looking for?

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:28.180
Hello.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:29.330
Hello.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.820
Is this Zhang Yan's home?

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.060
Why are you

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.700
looking for her?

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:39.570
Police.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:41.820
We need to ask a few questions.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.490
I don't know where she is.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.100
Has something happened to her?

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:50.730
Who are you to her?

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:52.690
I...

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:54.850
I'm her mother.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:57.980
Here's the thing.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.100
She's connected to one of our cases.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.610
But we haven't been able to reach her.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.460
Could you help us try to find her?

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:05.820
I...

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:13.220
Don't worry.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.100
I just need to ask a few questions.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.320
Do you two talk often?

00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.090
What are you doing?

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.100
Who let you in?

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:02.820
Get out.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:03.680
Hello.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:04.570
I'm a police officer.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.100
I need to ask Zhang Yan a few questions.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:10.200
There's no such person.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.490
Leave.

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:12.610
Go.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:13.570
Leave.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:14.940
Go.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.730
What are you doing?

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.890
You didn't even notice someone
walked into our house.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.980
You're not cooking
but busy chatting instead.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.370
Trying to starve me or what?

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.340
Help my mom inside.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.700
Mom, here.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:29.610
So clueless.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.580
Do you know where Zhang Yan is?

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.610
As I told you, there's no such person.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:38.450
Leave.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.010
What a strange family.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.100
How did your questioning go?

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.100
That was her mother.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.340
She kept stammering,

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.380
as if she knew something
but didn't dare to say it.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.130
Look how her husband treats her.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:02.850
She's scared of him.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.020
(Generous Buddha Blessings)

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.650
May the Buddha bless us.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:26.250
May the Buddha bless us.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:33.950
May the Buddha bless us.

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.490
Are you still in touch with Zhang Yan?

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.370
About two months ago,

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.850
she sent me a text message.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.820
(Daughter: Mom, I took Mengmeng abroad.
I'll contact you once we settle down.)

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:00.700
Do you know exactly where they went?

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:01.820
No idea.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.490
We hardly talk.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.460
Did something happen to her?

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.460
Why is it that you and your husband

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.220
both don't want to mention Zhang Yan?

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.220
Her dad

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.580
thinks Zhang Yan brings bad luck,

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:19.220
so he doesn't want to talk about her.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.490
What do you mean by that?

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.130
My husband's family has some old taboos.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.940
Only men are allowed on the boat.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.370
They think a daughter doesn't mean much.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.340
When Zhang Yan was born,

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.980
her dad didn't like her from the start.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:35.540
Later on,

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.180
I gave birth to her younger brother,

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.730
and she was pretty much forgotten.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.480
Whenever her dad was upset,

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:45.250
he would take it out on her.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.490
When she turned 14,

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.460
she fought back once.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.460
She ended up
with bruises around her eye.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.220
I told her:

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:56.850
I went through the same thing.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.820
If you don't fight back,

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.850
you'll get hurt less.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.340
That's what it means to be a woman.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.490
What kind of logic is that?

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:11.610
You're outsiders,

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:12.490
so you don't get it.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.490
Before Zhang Yan

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.730
finished high school,

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.220
her dad arranged a betrothal.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.250
She married Chen Tonghe
from the neighboring village.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.340
They barely saw each other

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.610
before getting married.

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.610
But at the wedding,

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.610
I remember Zhang Yan
seemed pretty happy.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:32.330
Maybe she just wanted

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:34.580
to get away from home asap.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.100
Is Chen Yiting

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:37.490
their daughter?

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:39.210
Yeah.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.580
Her nickname is Mengmeng.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:44.340
Where's her husband now?

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.580
He died while out fishing at sea.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.130
They never even found his body.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.730
Zhang Yan's in-laws decided
she was no longer of any use,

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:58.980
so they kicked her and the kid out.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:00.730
She took the kid

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:01.850
and went to work in the city.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:02.820
So, the last time

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.940
you were in touch was

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.730
two months ago?

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:08.780
Yeah.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.850
She even transferred 50,000 to me.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.730
I only noticed it later
when I checked the accounts.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.070
Chief Chen.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.700
Have you ever met these two?

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.610
No.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:32.340
Officer,

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.100
did something happen?

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.370
What's that case you mentioned about?

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:38.220
We haven't figured

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.340
everything out yet.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.850
But if Zhang Yan reaches out to you,

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:43.610
you must let us know.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:45.850
We're trying to help her,

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:46.850
not hurt her.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:47.940
Chief Liu.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.300
We've got a new lead.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:52.330
That's it.

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:02.080
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:03.730
She reached out to us.

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:05.860
Zhang Yan used to rent her apartment.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.420
If this were earlier in the year,

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:08.430
I could've rented it out

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:09.830
within two weeks.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:11.490
But now it's the end of the year.

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:13.630
Most people have gone back
to their hometowns.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.730
Yet they insisted on moving out now.

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.140
Are you saying

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:18.700
someone else was living here

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.460
besides Zhang Yan?

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:22.330
Yeah, Zhang Yan was here
with her daughter

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:23.330
and a man.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:28.090
Was it this man?

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:32.540
Yeah, that's him.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.010
He was Zhang Yan's boyfriend.

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:36.180
Do you know Zhang Yan?

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.220
She's my girlfriend.

00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:58.940
Have you cleaned up this place?

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.180
No, I haven't.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.770
At first, I was really upset.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.490
They have a kid with them.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:04.380
I thought

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:05.700
that when they moved out,

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.380
the place would be left in a total mess.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.290
But it turned out spotless.

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.700
Not a single item was left behind.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.570
When did they say they were leaving?

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.180
Two months ago,

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.460
she suddenly told me

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.380
they'd only rented
until the end of this month.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.050
They even gave up the deposit

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.460
and paid one extra month of rent.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.300
Ms. Wang.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.770
Did they say why?

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:27.540
No.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.220
I live across the hall.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.530
They used to come and go all the time.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.220
Then suddenly,
I realized I hadn't seen them around.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:35.730
So, I opened the door to check

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:36.980
and found out they'd moved out.

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.460
But before Zhang Yan left,

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.660
she really looked different.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.570
She had plastic wrap around her hand.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.700
Plastic wrap?

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:48.490
Where exactly?

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:49.820
Right here.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:52.730
I noticed

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:54.420
she had

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.220
a scar here.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:00.050
Do you know what kind of jobs

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:01.900
Zhang Yan and her boyfriend have?

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.250
Zhang Yan works as a sales clerk
at a cosmetics shop.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:05.980
But I'm not sure

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.140
what her boyfriend does.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.810
We almost never talked.

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:12.370
Officer,

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.240
I think Zhang Yan's boyfriend
might be cheating on her.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.700
One day,

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.180
when I was coming back...

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:35.490
Is this her?

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:39.730
I'm not sure.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.570
I didn't see her face.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:54.940
(Yuebishi)
Did you have an employee

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.730
named Zhang Yan?

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:57.570
Zhang Yan?

00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:59.770
She quit.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.380
When did she quit?

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.010
Around

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.460
two months ago.

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.180
Yeah, a little over two months ago.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.290
Did she say why she was leaving?

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.490
She told me

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.940
she wanted to live somewhere else.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:22.900
Other than that,

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:24.290
she didn't say much.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.290
Look at this guy.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:29.290
Have you seen him before?

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:30.490
Yeah.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:31.980
He's Zhang Yan's boyfriend.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.790
He used to come by often
to pick her up after work.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.570
But during the time
before Zhang Yan quit,

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:38.080
I didn't see him come around anymore.

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:41.140
I thought they were having issues.

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:42.980
Where's Zhang Yan now?

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.700
Her boyfriend

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.050
once came here.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.690
Zhang Yan asked for leave and left early

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:48.970
for something in the afternoon.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:49.840
She left?

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.420
You must've been busy lately,

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:54.210
so you're always
doing inventory at night.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:55.660
Busy? No.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:56.700
We're not doing inventory.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:00.140
Why is my mom always working overtime?

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.290
I don't know.

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:05.490
Maybe Zhang Yan
was lying to her boyfriend.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:07.220
Anyway, after that,

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.980
her boyfriend never showed up again.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.700
As for Zhang Yan,

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.530
she started to look worse and worse.

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:16.900
Her mood was often really low.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.140
Once, in the stairwell,

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.770
I saw Zhang Yan crouched there alone,

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:21.980
crying while holding her phone.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.330
I'm fine.

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:26.670
Oh, she also came to me

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:28.490
to ask for an advance
on her pay a few times.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:30.280
She said it was
for her daughter's treatment.

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.220
Can you get in touch with her now?

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:36.660
No, I can't.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.690
Two weeks ago, we had a promotion,
and we were short on staff.

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:41.900
I even wanted to ask her

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:42.980
if she was still in Pingtan

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.830
and if she could come help out
for a few days.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:46.420
But when I called her,

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.000
her phone had been off this whole time.

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:52.220
Xiaoxiao.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:53.570
Give a call

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.290
to Chief Chen.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:57.650
Tell them to assign more people

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.410
to find Zhang Yan while searching

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:01.140
for Lyu Danshun and Qin Hong.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:03.330
Why?

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.220
I've got

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:09.980
a bad feeling about this.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:19.060
(No Entry)

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:26.580
(Hongyuan Freezing Plant)

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.260
We're closed. Come back tomorrow.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:15.260
I'm looking for Feichuan.

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:23.490
Feichuan, someone's here to see you.

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:27.770
Let her in.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:29.220
Got it.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:31.740
Come with me.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:54.740
Feichuan.

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:09.050
Did Zhang Yan send you?

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:15.250
What are you to Zhang Yan?

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:16.500
We're friends.

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:25.730
This is you, right?

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:26.860
(Photo of suspect Qin Hong)

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.140
I didn't know Zhang Yan

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.050
had a friend accused of murder.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.980
The risk is way too high.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.380
I don't take risks.

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:45.490
Go find someone else.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:49.250
Zhang Yan said
that if even you can't make it happen,

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:50.140
then no one can.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.940
She's not wrong about that.

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:54.490
But it's the fishing ban season now.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.770
Every boat has a GPS on it.

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:58.490
As soon as one leaves the harbor,

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:00.660
the maritime bureau knows instantly.

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:03.700
No one's willing to take that risk.

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:05.420
Besides,

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.180
you're currently wanted by the police.

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:12.940
Feiyu, please help us out.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.220
Did Zhang Yan tell you

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.770
I'm Feichuan?

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.220
Feichuan.

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:21.460
Sorry about that.

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:24.700
Wait until the fishing season starts.

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:26.530
If you still haven't been arrested,

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:27.770
come find me again.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:32.570
How's that?

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:34.180
Zhang Yan said that if I come to you,

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.210
you'd definitely help out.

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:36.000
She helped me once,

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.080
and now you expect me to risk my life?

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:41.730
How naive.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.900
Besides, I don't know
what your connection

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.220
with Zhang Yan is.

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.140
Tell Zhang Yan to talk to me herself.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.820
She can't come.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:57.130
Why?

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:58.570
She's dead.

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:02.770
You mean the body Ma Weicheng
threw into the sea

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:04.940
was Zhang Yan?

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:09.490
We visited Zhang Yan's family

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:11.490
and her colleagues.

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:13.530
They all said that two months ago,

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:14.980
Zhang Yan could no longer be reached.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.250
That alone doesn't prove

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:17.660
Zhang Yan is really dead.

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.490
That's just my assumption.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.290
I have no solid evidence to back it up.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:23.890
Still, it's hard for me to imagine

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:25.250
someone like Ma Weicheng

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.570
would try to protect Qin Hong

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.420
at the cost of being accused of murder.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.420
So, I believe that on that night,

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:35.180
there was definitely a body

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:36.980
in Ma Weicheng's house.

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.780
(Zhang Yan)

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.490
Later, he threw it into the sea.

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:47.250
But that body

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.260
was not Qin Hong.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:54.730
Are you saying

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:57.810
Ma Weicheng was actually framed?

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.660
Everything he said was true?

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.730
Qin Hong's mother said she didn't have

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:05.910
a congenital heart condition.

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:07.130
So why did she

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.900
keep insisting that she had

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:11.660
a congenital heart condition

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.260
while she was seeing Ma Weicheng?

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.140
(Qin Hong)

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:16.490
Let's look back now.

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:18.570
The evidence we found
at Ma Weicheng's place,

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.050
along with the witness statements,

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:22.570
seems too perfect a match, right?

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.220
So, you mean

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:30.250
this whole thing was orchestrated

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:32.980
just to lead us to Ma Weicheng

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:34.420
and Qin Hong's death?

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.050
Once Qin Hong's death was confirmed,

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:41.670
we'd naturally close the case.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.790
(Qin Hong)

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:47.250
Qin Hong had to live

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:48.730
under a new identity.

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.810
She needed a new identity,

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:54.730
so she took it from an innocent woman?

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:02.900
We found out that Zhang Yan
had been seeing Lyu Danshun

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.490
before she went missing.

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:05.900
But

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:07.980
(Zhang Yan)
before she went missing,

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.250
their relationship
had started falling apart.

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:12.520
(Lyu Danshun)
Zhang Yan's landlord said

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.870
that when Zhang Yan wasn't home,

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.570
she saw Lyu Danshun with another woman

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:16.490
at the apartment.

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:20.700
So, I suspect that woman

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.770
might very well have been Qin Hong.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.140
After Qin Hong killed Huang Shuquan
in Chencang,

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:28.140
I talked to their neighbors.

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:30.250
All of them mentioned Lyu Danshun to me.

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:32.660
Most people thought they were

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:33.500
biological siblings.

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:36.180
In fact, they're not related
by blood at all.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.530
If Lyu Danshun

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:42.380
was willing to take risks
to help Qin Hong

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:43.530
stay on the run for so long,

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:45.810
then his feelings for Qin Hong

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:47.980
must've gone
far beyond ordinary affection.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:50.570
His feelings toward Qin Hong

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:51.940
(Qin Hong)

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.050
were strong enough for him
to break the law for her.

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:55.180
(Breaking the law for her)

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.250
What if

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.140
Lyu Danshun approached Zhang Yan

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:02.730
just to find a scapegoat

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:04.810
for Qin Hong?

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.940

My apartment

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:44.730
is a bit noisy,

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:46.530
but the price is pretty cheap.

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:49.820
Over here.

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.260
Take it slow.

- Yeah.

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:44.860
my troublemaker,

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.140
I'd be completely ruined by now.

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:47.420
Tell me what you need.

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:48.900
I'll help if I can.

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:49.940
Then I'll be direct.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:50.900
Sure.

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:54.940
Those two suspects

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:56.860
just escaped from Chang'an to Pingtan

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:57.980
with a kid.

00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:59.580
Can you help ask around?

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:00.740
We want to know

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:02.260
if the inn owners here have seen them.

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:03.460
Okay.

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:05.160
I'll check it out.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.340
I'll confirm with you later.

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:07.340
Thanks, Ms. Sun.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:08.460
It's nothing.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:10.500
I can tell

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.020
you're getting sharper by the day.

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.660
You've got the real detective vibe now.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:15.420
However,

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.820
you need to take care of your skin.

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:20.460
I'll bring you a couple of boxes
of cosmetics next time.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:22.980
No need for that.

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.720
If I can find those two soon,
I'll be spared a few sleepless nights.

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.500
This place has great food.

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:34.290
What?

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.660
It's oden. Try a bite.

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:39.270
Hey.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:40.220
Hello.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:42.460
Done.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:44.500
Try this.

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:46.620
I'm good; you go ahead.

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:48.070
Come on. It's good.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:48.520
No, no.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.050
- It's for young folks.
- It's tasty.

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:51.500
Seriously, just one bite.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:52.460
It's the house special.

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:53.260
Fine, just one bite.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.100
One bite.

00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:58.900
No flavor at all.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:00.260
Here, it's yours.

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:01.820
Alright then.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:07.860
What a surprise.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:09.600
There's another way to do this.

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:11.500
It just came to me suddenly.

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:14.100
Ms. Sun is just talkative,

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:15.420
but she's very kind

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:16.260
and helpful.

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.220
And she knows this whole area.

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:19.780
When we used

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:21.060
to check out potential suspects,

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.860
we'd often ask her
to keep an eye out for us.

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:25.140
She just mentioned

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:27.900
that your dad helped her find her son?

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.260
My dad is a cop, too.

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:32.600
He got injured on duty
years ago and retired.

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.380
Ms. Sun's boy ran away

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:37.300
during his rebellious phase.

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.080
She had no choice
but to call the police.

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:40.460
My dad happened to take that case.

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:42.460
The kid didn't do anything,

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:44.340
just ran off to another district,

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.060
and spent a few days
at an internet café.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:48.060
My dad found him and brought him back.

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:50.200
After that,
she's been grateful to my dad.

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.980
So, you came from a police family.

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:56.700
You think so?

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:57.780
You don't think so?

00:37:58.940 --> 00:37:59.780
Maybe.

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.780
You're actually like my dad.

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:09.740
In what way?

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:10.580
Personality.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:12.780
You're both stubborn.

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:18.460
I've got another favor to ask you.

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.380
Submit another request to Chief Chen.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.940
I want to question Ma Weicheng again.

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:33.220
(Pingtan Public Security Bureau,
Baocheng Branch)

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.300
(Pingtan First Detention Center)

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:36.140
Ma Weicheng.

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:39.380
We'd like to go over

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:41.460
a few more details that night.

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:47.820
I've told you so many times.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:50.420
I didn't kill anyone.

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:55.660
After you came back

00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:57.980
from the pharmacy and found

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:00.380
Lin Chang dead that night,

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:02.820
did you take a close look at her body?

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:07.260
The fuse blew out back then.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:09.300
It was dark.

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:12.420
I'd never seen a dead person before.

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:13.900
I was really scared.

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.300
But I saw the tattoo on her wrist.

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:21.940
Lin Chang, get up. Lin Chang.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:27.580
If you don't believe me,

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:30.340
why keep asking the same thing?

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.300
As I told you, I have no idea

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:34.900
what happened

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.740
with those bloodstains and screwdrivers.

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:39.660
She died from a heart attack.

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:49.700
Have you

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:50.980
seen him before?

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.420
No, I don't know him.

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.260
What about her?

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:10.580
You know her?

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:16.380
Her name is Zhang Yan.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:34.780
I get it.

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.100
I get it now.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.060
What do you mean?

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:44.860
She set me up.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.100
She's a con artist.

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:53.980
A con artist?

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:57.740
I served a few years before.

00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:58.940
You all know that, right?

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:02.060
But do you know why I ended up there?

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.820
Wasn't that for fraud?

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.260
I was running a business with Zhang Yan.

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:08.740
But later, she framed me for fraud

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.340
over how to split the profit.

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.940
Don't make yourself sound so innocent.

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:18.900
If there was no proof,

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:21.500
the cops wouldn't have arrested you.

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:22.500
Business is messy.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:24.620
Nothing is perfectly clean.

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:27.300
I'm not spotless myself,

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:29.380
and she's not innocent, either.

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.500
To keep all the money,

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:37.780
she dumped all the blame on me alone

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:39.900
and became the witness instead.

00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:41.580
That woman

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.020
would do anything for money.

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:44.940
Don't be fooled by her innocent face.

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:48.460
It must've been her who set me up.
