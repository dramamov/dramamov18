WEBVTT

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.270
Shall I proceed with the revision
to the will, as you instructed?

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.010
Yes, you must.
Regarding the clause on my unavailability,

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.080
delete the clause naming Min Kyung Chae
as acting chairman.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.720
Then you just need to name her replacement
as acting chairman.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:16.820
She's right here.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.720
Replace Min Kyung Chae with Jung Lucia.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.860
Also, watch what you say, Lawyer Park.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.770
You and Kim Sun Jae were classmates
at the judicial training institute, right?

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.930
Your life is more important
than your friendship. Isn't that right?

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.870
If you understand, amend it as directed
and have it notarized.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.710
You may go.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.780
You want to put me down...

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.950
as the acting chairman?

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.590
What more can I offer you
than something like this?

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.330
Chairman...

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.100
You look like you're about to cry.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.600
Are you that touched?

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.900
If I'd known you'd be this happy,
I would have done it much sooner.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.640
It's not that.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.970
I'm just so grateful
for your thoughtfulness.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.340
The company or the position
doesn't matter to me.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.950
I'm just truly grateful
for your generosity.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.250
I know.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.550
Of course I know how you feel.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.920
(Episode 94)

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.490
Is something wrong?

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:28.990
Did something happen?

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.830
What is it now?

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.470
Tae Kyung.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.840
Yes? What's wrong?

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.770
Chairman Min...

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.440
said he'd revise his will.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.240
He said he wanted me
as the acting chairman.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.980
What? Are you serious?

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.850
So he's really changing the will for you?

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.320
The lawyer just left a few moments ago.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.090
That's fantastic news.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.660
This means you're one step closer
to taking over Mingang Distribution.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.500
- What's the matter?
- I had a horrible dream.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.510
- What was it about?
- That woman, Lucia,

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.340
said she wasn't Jung Lucia
and revealed her true identity.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:20.980
Her true identity?

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.980
She said she was actually an alien.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.020
And then she just ripped off her mask!

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.950
I was so startled.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.630
It would be better if she were an alien.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.390
If you ever find out
who that woman really is...

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.030
How long do I have to just sit here?

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.230
Haven't you found a way yet?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.110
Come on, you're a brilliant lawyer.
This is when you're supposed to shine.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.840
According to Manager Gong, that woman,
Lucia, is glued to my father's side...

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.680
and won't let any of us kids see him.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.650
Isn't there some legal action we can take?

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.890
Keeping children from their parent
is punishable by law, isn't it?

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.150
If we go the legal route,

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.120
we'd have to prove her motives
for doing so,

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.730
and if so, our kidnapping of the chairman
would become public knowledge.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.000
Would you be okay with that?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.560
Then what are we supposed to do?

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.930
We have to do something!

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.770
Just be patient. I'm working on a plan.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.580
Se Ri, won't you come with me
to the hospital to see Kyung Chae?

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:33.750
What for?

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.220
What do you mean, "what for?"

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.720
We should go and see her
since she's lost her memory.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.490
You think this is funny?

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.290
Can't you see our family is
a complete disaster right now?

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.060
How could a child kidnap and imprison
their own father?

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.770
Honestly, I was shocked too,
but what can we do?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.840
What's done is done.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.940
Besides, our family was never normal
to begin with.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.580
The owner's family is always fighting.
That's just how it is.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.250
Haven't you ever seen it in dramas?

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.110
Are we in a drama?

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.220
I'm not going.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.650
I don't really want to see Kyung Chae.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.090
Come on, don't be like that. Let's go.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.990
Come on, Ji Seop already told me
the hospital and room number.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.690
Come on, you're the person
Kyung Chae wants to see the most.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.610
Lawyer Park.
Why are you calling all of a sudden?

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.280
I wrestled with this,
but I felt I had to tell you.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.310
Chairman Min Doo Sik
amended his will today.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.080
What are you talking about?
He amended his will?

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.450
What exactly did he change?

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.490
Everything else is the same,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.630
but he made Jung Lucia the acting chairman
instead of Min Kyung Chae.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.490
The acting chairman?

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.460
It's been notarized, so it's set in stone.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.300
The chairman basically made me choose
between our friendship and my career,

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.340
and since I owe you one,

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.070
I'm putting my neck on the line
to tell you this.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.510
The chairman changed his will?

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.010
Don't tell me...

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.650
he changed the acting chairman?

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.750
Apparently, he changed it to her.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.220
This can't be happening.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.490
The acting chairman is expected
to become the next chairman.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.760
He's going to hand Mingang Distribution
over to Lucia?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.100
Our family's business...

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.370
is going to be stolen
by a woman like that?

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.900
You need to double-check.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.540
Your friend could've gotten it wrong.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.940
But he said it's already been notarized.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.880
Ms. Kyung Chae, we're here.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.620
How are you feeling?

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.320
Are you okay, Kyung Chae?

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.730
Gosh, Kyung Chae, why are you crying?

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.470
- Are you in a lot of pain?
- What's wrong, Kyung Chae?

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.660
I think Kyung Chae has lost her mind,
not amnesia.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.700
No, if she's gone crazy,
she's gone completely off the deep end.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.110
Good grief.
If she's going crazy, do it with class.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.340
What are you going to do?

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.050
I said,
what are you going to do about this?

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.950
I told you to find a way sooner, didn't I?

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.620
You should've done whatever it took
to keep things from getting this bad.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.360
What are you good for?

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.100
You do nothing but make a mess.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.200
You just bought your law degree,
didn't you?

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.130
There's no way someone
as incompetent as you...

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.300
passed the bar on your own merit.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.370
Why make a mess you can't clean up?

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.340
Now that Lucia is the acting chairman,

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.510
you expect me to just stand by and watch?

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.580
That's enough already! Darn it.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.820
Just calm down!

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.030
Acting chairman?
Gosh, that was faster than I thought.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.330
Does this mean
you're taking over Mingang now?

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.700
I'm still way behind on shares.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.710
That is Min Doo Sik's last resort,

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.710
so expecting him to give up his shares
is premature.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.310
But getting this far is a huge step.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.050
You're incredible, Lucia.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.680
The acting chairman title is...

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.550
meaningless when Chairman Min is
still in charge.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:05.560
That's true. But he won't live forever.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.490
Sooner or later,
you'll be the one in that chair.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.990
When that happens,

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.030
the Min family's children
will all band together with their shares.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.030
They'll obviously try to block me
from being appointed as chairman.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.400
That's a problem for another day.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.470
For now, let's just celebrate.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.340
I'm on cloud nine today.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.710
Hey, why don't we have a glass of wine?

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.980
I've been saving a special bottle
for an occasion just like this.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.850
What? But it's the middle of the day.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.990
What are you talking about?
Drinking during the day is the best.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.890
You just became the acting chairman.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.230
It'd be a crime not to celebrate.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.120
I left the patient alone,
so just get to the point.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.990
Fine. I would've preferred to call,
but this was too important.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.630
I figured I should tell you this
in person.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.000
Fine, just get to the point.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.300
The chairman wants you
to end your leave...

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:23.470
and return to the company immediately.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.440
And if I refuse?

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.770
Why are you telling me that?
Are you defying the chairman?

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.710
Look, Moon Tae Kyung.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:34.850
I...

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.450
can't even stand
to look at your face right now.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.550
Do you have any idea how many times
I got hit in the head with a pillow today?

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:43.750
Of all the companies in the world,

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.320
why'd you have to join
Mingang Distribution...

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.390
just to trip me up at every turn?

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.560
Do you have some kind of grudge
against me?

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.400
Why are you and Lucia trying to ruin me?

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.670
If you keep this up, you'll be punished.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.070
Aren't you afraid of karma?

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.570
I've worked so hard to get here.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.280
I've never slept more than
five hours a night.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.810
I'd catnap in a tiny, closet-sized room
and live off instant noodles.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.650
That's how I endured it all
and kept studying.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.550
Just when I thought my life
was finally taking off...

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.090
What are you two, detectives?

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.390
Some kind of P.I.s?

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.790
Why would you go all the way there
and save the chairman?

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.000
Life is a boomerang.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.530
Just you wait.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.670
You'll get back exactly
what you dished out for getting in my way.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.980
Are you really not coming in to work?

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.140
The chairman is pretty furious.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.790
Boomerang. Don't you forget it.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.070
Take your time. Chew carefully.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.310
Have some broth first. Your mouth is dry.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.450
Take this away.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.620
Excuse me, sir?

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.920
I said take it away.
No one will be sitting there anymore.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.500
Honestly, Father,
we wanted to find you too.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.410
But you know,
the timing was just a little tricky.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.940
Kyung Chae insisted on finding you herself
and told us not to interfere.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.210
He's right. Even when you came back,

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.320
we wanted to rush out to greet you,

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.590
but Lucia wouldn't let us in.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.620
That's why.
It's not that we were trying to...

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.430
give you the cold shoulder
or anything like that.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:02.890
She's right.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.530
Everyone here was worried about you,
Father.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.600
- Right, Soo Jung?
- Of course.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:13.000
I was going to look for you myself,
despite what Kyung Chae said.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:16.440
I was going to hire people
to turn Seoul upside down.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.110
So please, don't hold anything
against us, Dad.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.920
Gosh, his silence is even more terrifying.

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:37.500
I know. He should be freaking out,
breaking things, and yelling at us.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.530
That would be normal.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.100
But, darling, I was so shocked
that I almost had a miscarriage.

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.200
Darling. Were you pregnant?

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.340
That's not what I meant.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:50.510
No, I went to the hospital to see
Kyung Chae today,

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.440
and I have to say,
she has completely lost it.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.310
She hasn't lost it. She has amnesia.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:59.420
No, she has lost it.
You just didn't see her for yourself.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.320
Anyway, the fact that your father...

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:04.960
had Kyung Chae's seat completely removed
from the table...

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.990
must mean he never plans
on seeing her again.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.830
I know. I thought he was just bluffing,
but is he really going to disown her?

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.070
Hey. What's on your mind?

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.470
I went to see Kyung Chae
at the hospital today.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:25.940
You did.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.080
Seeing Kyung Chae lately...

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.320
is hard because it reminds me
of how I used to be.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.080
How you used to be?

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:35.620
How so?

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.590
Selfish and self-centered.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.490
Someone who does wrong
but has no idea what they did.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.160
The thing is...

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.530
I caused an accident.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.570
It was four years ago,
right after I got back from the States.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:56.740
What kind of accident?

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.380
Someone...

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:02.180
died because of me.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:08.950
Who died?

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:17.900
So you regret it?

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.360
Did you feel any remorse?

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.770
Do you even think you did anything wrong?

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:31.580
I should be going.

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:46.360
Proceed as planned.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.560
I wasn't sure what you'd want for dinner,
so I made reservations at several places.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.700
Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and fusion.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:57.230
Sir, you really didn't have to go
to all that trouble.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:01.340
Don't worry, I'll cover the fees.
Just pick the one you like best.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.570
Which one do you want to go to the most?

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.940
In that case, I'll go with Japanese.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:09.050
Let's do that.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:12.780
By the way, did you tell
Lawyer Kim to come back to work?

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.150
- What did he say?
- He's very adamant.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:17.920
I don't think he's going to listen.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.660
Even if it's a direct order from me?

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:23.930
That brat...

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.200
He has no respect whatsoever.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:44.850
Seriously, why are you being like this?

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.150
Are you trying to drive yourself crazy?

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:51.390
If only I could, I would.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.590
If you lose your mind,

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:58.560
then what becomes of me
when I've done nothing but fight for you?

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.230
You need to get a grip.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.730
You didn't have lunch, did you?

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.570
Here, at least have this.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.670
You need to eat and keep fighting.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.670
Just because she's the acting chairman now
doesn't mean it's over.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.480
We still have the upper hand
with Mingang Distribution's shares.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:16.950
But what if Father gives
his entire stake to her?

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.320
No.
It wouldn't be easy even for the chairman.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.720
Giving her his entire stake means
she'd become the largest shareholder.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.920
And then there would be
no checks and balances left.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:31.530
That means if she sold the firm on a whim,
there'd be no legal way to stop her.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.100
Do you really think he would go that far?

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:44.510
Haven't you eaten either, Lawyer Kim?

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.310
What's with the seaweed soup?

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:51.180
I don't like it. The texture is so slimy.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.020
Just throw it out.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.250
Do you not know what today is?

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.720
I'm pretty sure
I mentioned it to you before.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.460
What's the occasion?

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.160
Is it your birthday, Lawyer Kim?

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.190
Like that's such a big deal.

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:06.930
Do you really think we're in a position
to celebrate a birthday right now?

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:09.600
Anyway, I don't like it, so take it away.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.040
She has a point.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.780
What's the big deal about a birthday?

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:37.560
I was so busy, I could only make this.
I'm sorry.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.600
No, what do you mean?
This is more than enough.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.530
We could have just let the day pass.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.770
Of course not.
Seaweed soup on your birthday is a must.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:48.840
Happy birthday, darling.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:51.640
I'm so, so happy you were born.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.250
You're the only one
who cares about my birthday, Sul Hee.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.880
Thank you.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:59.280
- Should I dig in?
- Yes.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:03.090
I haven't had seaweed soup in a while.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:07.590
It's delicious.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.030
Instead of just saying "thank you,"

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.570
there's something else I'd rather hear.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.240
Come on, you know
I'm not good with words like that.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.240
All right.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.110
I love you.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.190
Come to think of it,
we really were like that once.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.360
But what a shame, Baek Sul Hee.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.870
I can't just stand by
and let you be any more.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.700
The idea of some diner lady
becoming the acting chairman overnight...

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.400
I just can't stomach it.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.510
That's just plain wrong.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:57.340
No matter how crazy this world has gotten.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.840
Darn it.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.230
Who are you people?

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.570
Don't you dare lay a finger on me.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.300
I'm a lawyer. Don't you know
what happens if you mess with a lawyer?

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:29.440
Darn it, I swear...

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.980
I'm calling the police!
This isn't the dark ages.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.380
You worthless thugs.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:36.950
Exactly.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:40.850
Who in this day and age
would kidnap and imprison someone?

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:42.850
And a lawyer, no less.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.460
Did the chairman send you?

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.560
Our orders were to teach you a lesson
on how the world works.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:50.930
So come with us quietly, Mr. Lawyer.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.700
At first, I even suspected something
was going on between you and my wife.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:05.180
The insecurities of an old husband
with a young wife, I suppose.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.520
But then again, that punk Lawyer Kim
didn't exactly help matters.

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:13.020
Those motel pictures, for example.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.420
Yes.

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:22.090
Yes, I understand.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:23.830
Anyone in your shoes would have.

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:27.860
But now, I trust you and Lucia
more than my own children.

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:32.040
I know you'll stand by me to the very end,
even if the whole world turns its back.

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:35.940
So...

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.640
From now on,

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.280
how about you stop being a director
and be my son instead?

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:42.910
Your son?

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:46.120
Ji Seop is a pushover. Even his
younger sisters walk all over him.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.850
With him as my only son,

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:50.520
how frustrating would that be for me?

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:53.820
I've always wanted a son I could count on.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:56.730
Be my son.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.370
From now on,

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.100
we're father and son.

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:11.040
You murdered my parents
and made it look like an accident.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:14.210
You devoured my father's new technology
and his company.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.620
You're a monster who even killed Pil Doo
to keep the truth from getting out.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:19.820
And you want us to be father and son?

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.690
Your judgment day is coming.

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.420
I...

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.660
will make sure you stand trial.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.730
That really hurts. You punks!

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.170
Come on. Bring it on!

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:45.810
Darn it.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:47.310
You guys...

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.050
I ranked 11th on the national bar exam.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.620
I graduated top of my class
from the judicial training institute.

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.490
I'm on a whole other level
than losers like you. Got it?

00:21:58.820 --> 00:21:59.890
You, get over here.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.230
Darn it.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:12.340
Hey!

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.340
Who said you could dodge?

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.110
This little punk keeps dodging.

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:18.640
Hey.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.480
You're messing with the wrong person.
I'm Kim Sun Jae.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.220
A man so perfect,
he makes deities feel insecure.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.550
I'm Kim Sun Jae!

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:27.750
Enough of that.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.290
You have until tomorrow
to bring the secret ledger.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:32.120
If you don't, this will be
the least of your worries.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.560
You think I'm crazy to give you that?

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.300
The moment I hand it over,
you'll make me disappear without a trace.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.930
Do you think I'm a fool?

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:41.970
I'm not handing it over.
Over my dead body.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:46.270
As long as I have it,
even Chairman Min Doo Sik can't touch me.

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:49.810
Because if push comes to shove,
I'll leak everything.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.710
So do your worst, you punks!

00:22:58.150 --> 00:22:59.250
Yes, sir.

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:01.020
He won't cooperate. What should we do?

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.550
Right now?

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:05.390
Understood.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:09.490
The chairman wants a word with you.

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.580
Why aren't you cooperating?
I told you to bring the ledger.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.380
It's my only lifeline.
I can't just give it up.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.350
Are you trying to blackmail me with it?

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.950
Before that ledger
ever sees the light of day,

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.320
you'll be the one who disappears
from this world.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.560
You dare deceive me and pull a fast one?

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.560
Director Moon figured it all out.

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.370
He figured out what you were doing
with my slush fund.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:53.970
Did you think kidnapping me
would bury the truth forever?

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.810
The only reason I've tolerated you
is for your pathetic little talent,

00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.340
and I don't need it anymore.

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:01.210
Bring me the ledger.

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:04.450
I've already found someone else
to manage it for me.

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:06.550
And who might that be?

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.490
Don't tell me...

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:11.920
Are you really letting the fox
guard the henhouse?

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:29.410
As if there's a bigger fox
out there than you.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.640
Tomorrow.

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:36.850
Bring the ledger to my office tomorrow.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.950
And if you try anything funny,

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:42.190
you'll wish you were never born.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.210
This is one heck of a birthday present.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:26.960
Sun Jae? It's your auntie.

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:30.130
It's your birthday today.
Did you have some seaweed soup?

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.940
Why aren't you answering?

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:37.210
Hello? Isn't this Sun Jae's phone?

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:38.440
Hello?

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:41.610
Did I dial the wrong number?

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:43.910
It's me, Auntie.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:45.950
Sun Jae, there you are.

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:48.080
Wait, what's wrong with your voice?

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.590
Are you sick?

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:52.120
I'm not doing so great right now.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:54.060
What do you mean, you're not doing great?

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.790
I got a little beat up.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:59.730
I ran into some thugs
on my way home from work.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:01.160
What?

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.930
How bad is it? Where'd you get hurt?

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.170
Oh my gosh, where are you?
I'll come to you.

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:08.640
No, wait. On second thought,
you come here.

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.640
You know I rented out
Ja Kyung's old room, right?

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:13.680
The guy renting it is very well-connected.

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:16.050
He knows many cops,
so I'm sure he can help.

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:20.450
When we had that break-in last time,
he's the one who took the guy down.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.090
Wait! You actually know him.

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:26.560
He said he was a director at your company.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.330
Oh my goodness.
He told me not to say anything.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.060
Me and my big mouth.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:35.500
A director at my company?

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.870
Was his name Moon Tae Kyung by any chance?

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:40.800
Right.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:42.440
Yes, I think that was it.

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:44.070
Goodness!

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:46.040
You have to pretend you don't know,
all right?

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:48.450
So you're saying he's actually living
in that house?

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:50.550
Yes, that's what I'm telling you.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.420
I'm on my way, Auntie.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:59.860
The ledger Baek Sul Hee stole
ended up with Moon Tae Kyung,

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:03.890
which means it must be
in that room right now.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.470
So there is a light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:17.210
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:33.720
Where on earth did he put that ledger?

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:34.920
Where did it go?

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.160
Is something missing from your room?

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.860
So what happened to that woman
after her daughter died?

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:40.960
Are you curious? Just you wait.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.070
We have no other choice.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.200
We have to use our shares to stop her.

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:46.870
So, did you return the ledger to him?

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.240
I couldn't just do that.
Guess what I gave him instead?

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.780
You think you can take me down?
Not a chance.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:55.410
Not a chance!

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:00.980
