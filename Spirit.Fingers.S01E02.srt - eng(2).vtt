Yeah, it's fun.

Still challenging though.

Beginners usually struggle with basic lines.

Your lines are strong,

00:15:18.833 --> 00:15:23.000

your skill will probably improve quickly.

You're using a sketchbook, right?

It's better to use a croquis book.

Croquis book?

00:15:38.433 --> 00:15:40.433
Croquis requires speed, you know.

That's why we use lighter paper
with a smooth surface.

I'm too sick today, so I don't think I can go...

Yesterday, my mom went to pick up my brother,

and she made a left turn at the intersection
in front of the convenience store.

But a puppy suddenly ran out in front of her car,

she swerved sharply to avoid it,
so the car skidded.

00:26:34.033 --> 00:26:35.733
It crashed into a utility pole.

She ate peanut snacks, her throat swelled up,
and she had trouble breathing,

Oh no, so she has a peanut allergy.

Is that true?

00:27:24.567 --> 00:27:25.933
Of course it's true.

Why would she lie to me?

00:27:28.833 --> 00:27:31.600
Are you just being confident
or are you actually naive?

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.767
But why are you trying to bring her here?

00:27:37.167 --> 00:27:40.633
I want to show her
who dared to ignore my messages.

00:27:40.633 --> 00:27:44.133
I want her to see it clearly with her own eyes.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.733
I just wanted to bring her here
to make her run errands for me.

This size is perfect. What do you think?

00:28:16.833 --> 00:28:18.967
- Yes.
- Then buy this one.

00:28:18.967 --> 00:28:20.733
You needed pencils too, right?

00:28:20.733 --> 00:28:22.467
Yes, that's correct.

00:28:23.567 --> 00:28:25.533
As for pencils...

00:28:25.533 --> 00:28:27.600
Oh, there.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.067
Wait a second.

00:28:34.467 --> 00:28:36.933
Since your hands are small,

00:28:36.933 --> 00:28:38.867
this might be better.

00:28:44.633 --> 00:28:48.767
How did he know I have small hands?

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.500
An eraser?

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.767
When doing croquis, even if you draw a wrong line,

00:29:24.767 --> 00:29:26.800
it's better to draw a new line over it.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.700
No time to erase.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:33.300
But sometimes you want to
erase everything and start fresh, right?

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.933
That's when you use this to wipe it all away.

00:29:35.933 --> 00:29:39.100
It's the best eraser I've ever used.

00:29:40.767 --> 00:29:43.000
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.600

Wow, your voice sounds great.

00:30:34.067 --> 00:30:38.100

You're not scared at all?

00:32:00.233 --> 00:32:01.700
You told me not to be scared!

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.700
Hey, you only listen to half of what I say?

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:07.667
I said don't cower unless you did something wrong.

00:32:07.667 --> 00:32:09.700
But you did wrong me!

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.700
You lied!

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:11.933
You did it before too!

00:32:11.933 --> 00:32:13.400
Ignoring my messages!

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.233
You keep wronging me.

00:32:15.233 --> 00:32:16.900
Right? Am I wrong?

00:32:17.633 --> 00:32:19.533
If you didn't want to meet me,
you should've just said so.

00:32:19.533 --> 00:32:21.200
Why would you lie?

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.233
If you're going to lie,

00:32:22.233 --> 00:32:24.100
at least don't get caught!

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.367
You said you wanted us to get along!

00:32:25.367 --> 00:32:26.867
No,

00:32:26.867 --> 00:32:28.867
I take back my offer to be friends!

00:32:28.867 --> 00:32:31.167
- What?
- You're so self-centered.

00:32:31.167 --> 00:32:33.233
Glaring intimidatingly at people over nothing.

00:32:33.233 --> 00:32:35.633
You enjoy scaring me?

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:38.000
Now that I think about it,

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
when did we become friends?

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.067
I don't know why I need to be nice to you.

[Excerpt: Why did you lie?]

[If you didn't want to meet me,
you should've just said so]

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.600
If you didn't want to meet me,
you should've just said so.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.733
Why would you lie?

00:33:15.733 --> 00:33:17.200
If you're going to lie,

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.033
at least don't get caught!

You said you wanted us to get along!

00:33:20.267 --> 00:33:23.167
No, I take back my offer to be friends.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.900
Oh, come on.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.767

00:34:28.633 --> 00:34:30.467
Did they...

00:34:30.467 --> 00:34:32.133
Did they fight?

00:34:32.133 --> 00:34:34.900
They kept acting weird during the meeting earlier.

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.500
Well, I don't know.

00:34:37.367 --> 00:34:38.967
Jeez, these kids...

00:34:38.967 --> 00:34:40.333
I wanted to have a nice picnic
with them for the first time in a while,

00:34:40.333 --> 00:34:42.967
but these little guys
are totally ruining the vibe.

00:34:42.967 --> 00:34:44.500
What's your problem, seriously?

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.300
Should I make you cry, for real?

00:34:47.933 --> 00:34:50.000
Hey, Nam Gi Jeong.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.200
I told you not to come to meetings.

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.900
You! Come out now!

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:57.300
- What's this about?
- Get out here, you punk.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.700
- Wait a minute.
- Are you crazy?

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.433
You ruined our peaceful SF atmosphere.
I'll never forgive you for this.

00:35:01.433 --> 00:35:02.567
Are you the hero of the world or something?

00:35:02.567 --> 00:35:04.233
Hey, come out!

00:35:05.933 --> 00:35:09.667
Don't know what happened between you two,
but make up if you fought.

00:35:09.667 --> 00:35:11.267
Geu Rin isn't wrong,

00:35:11.267 --> 00:35:13.500
and you're ruining the club's mood.

00:35:17.467 --> 00:35:19.333
I'll give you ten minutes.

00:35:30.233 --> 00:35:31.933
People grow through fights, right?

00:35:31.933 --> 00:35:33.733
And that's how friendships deepen.

00:35:33.733 --> 00:35:36.167
Truthfully, I fought constantly
with Koo Seon Ho at that age too.

00:35:36.167 --> 00:35:38.233
You've been friends since middle school, right?

00:35:38.233 --> 00:35:40.633
Yes. I practically raised him.

00:35:40.633 --> 00:35:41.767
Speak properly.

00:35:41.767 --> 00:35:43.167
I'm the one who raised you.

00:35:43.167 --> 00:35:44.167
What are you saying?

00:35:44.167 --> 00:35:47.867
So friendships between men
and women can exist, huh?

00:35:47.867 --> 00:35:50.500
There's no such thing as friends
between men and women.

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:53.467
Why not? We're here, me and Koo Seon Ho.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.467
You two have kissed, right?

00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.333
Oh, unnie!

00:35:59.333 --> 00:36:00.400
Look at Seon Ho.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.333
He's so handsome.

00:36:02.333 --> 00:36:06.167
If I were you, I'd date him fast
before someone steals him.

00:36:07.233 --> 00:36:12.267
So Geu Rin, have you never
once seen Seon Ho as a guy?

00:36:12.267 --> 00:36:14.100
I swear, not even once.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.400
We're super-duper genuine besties.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.400
Don't believe that 'super genuine' act.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.067
Who knows what'll happen next.

00:36:21.067 --> 00:36:22.533
Ugh, frustrating! Hey, Koo Seon Ho.

00:36:22.533 --> 00:36:24.433
Say something.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:34.833
I found the answer.

00:36:36.667 --> 00:36:38.500
What about you?

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:42.133
- What?
- You asked why I should stay friends with you.

00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:45.333
I've been thinking for days, and I figured it out.

00:36:45.333 --> 00:36:46.567
That wasn't actually a question...

00:36:46.567 --> 00:36:48.567
You keep making me

00:36:49.233 --> 00:36:51.567
think about things.

00:36:51.567 --> 00:36:53.800
- What?
- Is the correct spelling 'wana'

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.000
or 'wanna,' you make me think.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.867
I've lived without thinking until now.

00:36:56.867 --> 00:37:00.400
But you keep making me think about things.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.933
Look, even now

00:37:02.933 --> 00:37:04.600
I've been thinking for days about

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.800
why I should get along with you.

00:37:09.067 --> 00:37:13.100
Have you really never thought about this at all?

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.900
- Nope.
- No worries?

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:16.700
- Nope.
- But you're bad at studying.

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.633
Doesn't that stress you?

00:37:18.633 --> 00:37:20.233
Your parents don't say anything?

00:37:20.233 --> 00:37:21.267
They never mention it.

00:37:21.267 --> 00:37:22.900
Really?

00:37:23.967 --> 00:37:26.100
How come they don't?

00:37:26.967 --> 00:37:28.000
Lucky you.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.167
Hey.

00:37:29.167 --> 00:37:31.100
What do your parents say?

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.100
You're top of the class.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:36.567
Aren't your parents being too demanding?

00:37:37.533 --> 00:37:40.133
I'm not even good.

00:37:40.133 --> 00:37:42.200
Just average.

00:37:47.333 --> 00:37:50.567
Hey, is getting average even good?

00:37:58.667 --> 00:38:01.600
Anyway, I said it.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.233
Why I should stay friends with you.

00:38:03.233 --> 00:38:05.133
Now find your own reason.

00:38:15.467 --> 00:38:18.300
I'm sorry I lied that day.

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.767
Let's reschedule our missed meeting.

00:38:26.667 --> 00:38:27.800
Look, look, look.

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.800
Look, you saw this, right?

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:33.833
The girl who ignored my messages
is asking to meet first.

00:38:33.833 --> 00:38:37.567
This round too, I, Nam Gi Jeong, won!

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.233
Told you!

00:38:44.233 --> 00:38:45.433
I'd win!

00:38:45.433 --> 00:38:46.467
He's insane.

00:38:46.467 --> 00:38:47.500
He's insane.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:48.867
He's insane.

00:38:48.867 --> 00:38:51.633
- For sure.
- I won!

00:38:51.633 --> 00:38:53.333
I, Nam Gi Jeong,

00:38:53.333 --> 00:38:55.367
will never lose!

00:39:20.067 --> 00:39:22.500
Hey! Look at me.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.500
Hey, I said look!

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.100
Miss Piggy.

Huh? Let's check that out.

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.100
What's up?

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.500
Hey, what are you doing?

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:41.633
I'm bored.

00:39:41.633 --> 00:39:42.667
Shh.

00:39:42.667 --> 00:39:45.600
Hey, let's hang out.

00:39:47.467 --> 00:39:48.733
Why?

00:39:48.733 --> 00:39:50.467
Is this your favorite restaurant?

00:39:50.467 --> 00:39:51.833
Yeah, this place is amazing.

00:39:51.833 --> 00:39:53.200
I'll be expecting it.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.667
- Wow.
- Thanks.

00:39:54.667 --> 00:39:57.133
Check this out.

00:39:57.133 --> 00:39:58.967
I can eat this fishcake in one bite.

00:39:58.967 --> 00:40:00.933
- My mouth's huge.
- It's probably hot.

00:40:02.167 --> 00:40:03.367
- Oh, it's hot.
- Hey.

00:40:03.367 --> 00:40:05.067
You okay?

00:40:18.367 --> 00:40:20.100
Cut it out with the smoking.

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.733
Jeez, you scared me.

00:40:21.733 --> 00:40:22.733
You're here, Ye Rim.

00:40:22.733 --> 00:40:24.200
Why so late?

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.500
- Look at this.
- What's this?

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:27.900
While organizing my photos,

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.600
I found those subway creep shots we talked about.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.433
Crazy, right?

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.433
You're still doing this?

00:40:37.433 --> 00:40:39.067
So immature.

00:40:39.067 --> 00:40:40.867
What's the big deal? It's just a joke.

00:40:40.867 --> 00:40:42.667
Why are you so down?

00:40:42.667 --> 00:40:44.000
What's going on?

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.500
No idea. I don't know, maybe he got a girlfriend.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:48.800
Something feels off.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.833
No way. Seriously?

00:40:50.833 --> 00:40:53.733
You said that guy was cute
being an eternal single.

00:40:53.733 --> 00:40:55.333
Hey.

00:40:57.067 --> 00:40:59.233
What did you just say?

00:40:59.867 --> 00:41:01.300
'That guy'?

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.367
Wait, you just...

00:41:02.367 --> 00:41:03.600
Park Lee Jin.

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.500
You've grown some nerves, huh?

00:41:06.533 --> 00:41:10.633
Back in middle school,
you couldn't even look me in the eye.

00:41:10.633 --> 00:41:14.367
But now, because I'm being nice to you,
you think I'm an easy target?

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.533
- Sorry.
- Ugh, why's it so tense?

00:41:17.533 --> 00:41:19.533
I'm telling you, watch your mouth, Lee Jin.

00:41:19.533 --> 00:41:20.667
This darn mouth of yours.

00:41:20.667 --> 00:41:22.100
The mouth's the problem.

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.633
Ye Rim, you cool it.

00:41:23.633 --> 00:41:26.033
This drama queen always does this.

[Gi Jeong, what are you doing?]

00:41:39.433 --> 00:41:43.467
What exactly did we do today anyway?

00:41:43.467 --> 00:41:44.600
- Huh?
- Well, we had lunch,

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.067
went to a bookstore, then to a gaming room.

00:41:48.067 --> 00:41:50.467
Wait, what did you want to do with me last time?

00:41:50.467 --> 00:41:53.733
You're the one who asked to meet today.

00:41:53.733 --> 00:41:55.267
What?

00:41:55.267 --> 00:41:58.167
Well, that's true, but...

00:41:58.167 --> 00:42:00.267
This is ridiculous.

00:42:00.267 --> 00:42:03.467
Hey, from what you're saying...

00:42:03.467 --> 00:42:04.833
What is this?

00:42:04.833 --> 00:42:06.600
Is this a date or something?

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.300
You wanted to date me?

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:10.833
Do you like me?

00:42:10.833 --> 00:42:12.100
What are you saying?

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:13.767
Why would I go on a date with you?

00:42:13.767 --> 00:42:16.633
Hey, don't talk like that again,

00:42:16.633 --> 00:42:18.200
or I'll think again about

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.533
why I should go on a date with you.

00:42:19.533 --> 00:42:23.467
So don't just ask random questions.

00:42:23.467 --> 00:42:26.200
This isn't a question.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.633
You didn't ask me, did you?

00:42:28.633 --> 00:42:29.900
What's your Korean score?

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:34.967
It depends on the day,
but I keep it between the low to mid 40s.

00:42:34.967 --> 00:42:37.000
- Welcome.
- You've grown some nerves.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.400
Who does she think she is?

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:41.000
Enough. Want a drink?

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.933
I'll have iced americano.

00:42:43.933 --> 00:42:44.967
Same.

00:42:44.967 --> 00:42:47.800
I'll have three iced drinks
and one of these, please.

00:42:48.433 --> 00:42:50.333
Insert your card at the front.

00:42:50.333 --> 00:42:52.367
All set. I'll call when ready.

00:42:52.367 --> 00:42:54.400
Thanks.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.233
Let's go now.

00:42:57.567 --> 00:42:59.267
Go where?

00:42:59.267 --> 00:43:00.867
Sit.

00:43:07.967 --> 00:43:10.100
Thought you forgot what I said,

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.033
but you didn't.

00:43:12.033 --> 00:43:14.033
Why are you pretending like you forgot?

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:17.567
Don't be scared.

00:43:19.067 --> 00:43:20.933
You did nothing wrong.

00:43:23.933 --> 00:43:27.800
What do you regret most about that day?

00:43:31.367 --> 00:43:32.400
Backing down.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.433
You glared at me again, right?

00:43:35.433 --> 00:43:37.800
No, just looking.

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:40.467
Why did you stare at me like that?

00:43:40.467 --> 00:43:43.667
I just thought the tint looks pretty.

00:43:43.667 --> 00:43:44.800
She said your tint looks pretty.

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.467
I said that because I was scared of them,

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.800
it wasn't what I really meant.

00:43:51.767 --> 00:43:53.400
Satisfied, Miss?

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.800
Whoa, goddess appeared.

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.033
- Amazing.
- I can post this online, right?

00:43:58.033 --> 00:44:00.167
The fact that I couldn't say anything

00:44:01.633 --> 00:44:04.000
even after ending up like that,

00:44:07.133 --> 00:44:10.333
that's what I regret the most.

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:16.900
Let's go to the bathroom.

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:18.200
I need to fix my makeup.

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.667
What if drinks pop up then?

00:44:19.667 --> 00:44:21.767
We'll get them later or something.

00:44:21.767 --> 00:44:24.333
Go finish everything now.

00:44:24.333 --> 00:44:26.233
No, I won't.

00:44:26.233 --> 00:44:28.800
- Go and tell them everything.
- I don't want to.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:33.500
I wouldn't have spoken up anyway.

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:36.500
What's different between then and now?

00:44:38.467 --> 00:44:42.333
I'm right behind you.

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.167
Huh?

00:44:52.867 --> 00:44:54.800
You again?

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.967
I guess we're really connected to the bathroom.

00:45:02.233 --> 00:45:04.433
No makeup today, loser?

Why didn't you do your makeup?

Didn't you like the makeup I did last time?

Hey.

Are you deaf?

00:45:22.867 --> 00:45:26.100
You just want me to do your makeup again, huh?

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.800
Fine, this time,

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.067
I'll make it way prettier than last time.

00:45:30.067 --> 00:45:31.867
Come over here.

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:34.467
See this?

Did you just hit me?

00:45:35.867 --> 00:45:36.867
Yeah.

00:45:36.867 --> 00:45:38.500
'Yeah'?

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:40.600
What did you just say?

00:45:41.367 --> 00:45:43.533
What's with those eyes?

00:45:43.533 --> 00:45:45.800
You glaring at me?

Yeah.

Hey, loser! Come back here?

Hey, loser.

00:46:11.633 --> 00:46:12.967
Who's that? Someone you know?

00:46:12.967 --> 00:46:14.067
I don't know.

00:46:14.067 --> 00:46:15.467
You don't know? Let's go.

00:46:15.467 --> 00:46:17.700
Everyone's watching. Cut it out.

00:46:23.233 --> 00:46:25.067
Hey, she's not coming.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.600
Ah, my bag.

00:46:30.067 --> 00:46:32.300
Ah, that felt so good.

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:33.500
It wasn't anything special, right?

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:35.600
Yeah, totally nothing.

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:37.367
Why couldn't I do this before?

00:46:37.367 --> 00:46:39.600
Today's the most satisfying day of my life.

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.500
Right, keep doing that.

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.200
Say everything you want to say.

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.200

Next time, I'll teach you
how to curse properly. Okay?

Bigfoot, let's go.

Alright, three minutes up.

What?

00:48:53.133 --> 00:48:54.967
Why do you draw so well?

00:48:58.167 --> 00:48:59.800
What?

00:49:05.033 --> 00:49:08.200
Okay, okay. I won't laugh.

Show me your drawing.

- Don't laugh.
- Got it.

Hey, there's no face.

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:20.767
Even if the time is short,
eyes, nose, and mouth are essential.

00:49:20.767 --> 00:49:23.533
What? Last time was chaos.

00:49:23.533 --> 00:49:25.533
Now they are so close?

00:49:25.533 --> 00:49:26.600
They're kids.

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:29.433
At that age, you could kiss
and still stay friends.

00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:30.500
Unnie.

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.400

I don't know. My stomach feels queasy and weird.

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:50.233
Hey, why are you...

00:57:50.233 --> 00:57:55.867
â™« Tell me, you already know â™«

00:57:55.867 --> 00:58:00.133
â™« You know exactly what I'm trying to say â™«

00:58:00.133 --> 00:58:02.300
Do you like Seon Ho?

00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:07.100
Do you?

00:58:15.567 --> 00:58:18.133
Why can't I like Seon Ho?

00:58:18.133 --> 00:58:19.133
Wait, you like Seon Ho?

00:58:19.133 --> 00:58:20.567
So that's why you were upset?

00:58:20.567 --> 00:58:22.200
That's it, the anger, it's the anger.

00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:24.400
Or mad because he likes U Yeon.

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:25.833
You two actually look good together.

00:58:25.833 --> 00:58:27.667
There's no decent man in my life.

00:58:27.667 --> 00:58:30.200
Let's try it once before we die, girl crush.

00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:32.233
What? This was supposed to be
a girl crush concept!

00:58:32.233 --> 00:58:33.500
You look cute in anything.

00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:36.067
How long have you been staring at this chapter?

00:58:36.067 --> 00:58:37.824
What's making you so nervous all the time?

00:58:37.824 --> 00:58:38.880
Just go bold.

00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:39.968
U Yeon.

00:58:39.968 --> 00:58:42.167
I'll keep my feelings for him
to myself like before.

00:58:42.167 --> 00:58:43.867
Stop worrying.

00:58:43.867 --> 00:58:46.233
Quit crushing quietly.

00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.467
Darn it!

00:58:58.467 --> 00:59:01.000
Keep your eyes open!

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.267
Sorry.

00:59:02.267 --> 00:59:04.933
You are wearing trashy clothes, loser.

00:59:04.933 --> 00:59:07.833
- Darn it.
- So annoying.

00:59:07.833 --> 00:59:08.867
Exactly.

00:59:08.867 --> 00:59:10.700
Even Class 3 losers wouldn't wear
something like that, right?

00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:11.867
Hey!

00:59:11.867 --> 00:59:12.933
What!

00:59:12.933 --> 00:59:13.967
Is she insane?

00:59:13.967 --> 00:59:16.267
- Hey, stop her.
- Hold on, hold on.

00:59:17.233 --> 00:59:18.933
Don't live like that.

00:59:18.933 --> 00:59:20.567
Got it?

00:59:22.033 --> 00:59:23.767
Sorry.
