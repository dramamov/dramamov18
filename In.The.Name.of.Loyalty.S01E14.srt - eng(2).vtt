=Episode 14=

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.079
I know where the antidote formula

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.640
for the Frost Poison is.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.119
It's okay now.

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:48.439
It's okay now.

00:01:03.584 --> 00:01:05.632
(To my brother)

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.719
(Ji,)

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.879
(don't look for me.)

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:16.000
(I've endured enough suffering
in the palace.)

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.799
(Now I just want to be free.)

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.480
(The position as the Empress,
I no longer want it.)

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.000
My lord.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.280
My lord.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.640
My lord!

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.439
My lord,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.000
His Majesty and the waiting maid
Cheng Ge...

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.088
Bring the Empress back to me. Now!

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.840
Yes.

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.376
(Yunjing)

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.120
Dolls, sachets, and trinkets!

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.159
Come take a look!

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.120
Lady, come take a look.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.424
How's your poison?

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.800
Don't worry.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:02.319
It's been cured.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.080
That's good.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.919
Come on.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.639
I'll do it myself.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.240
There's only you and me here.

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:16.608
No one else.

00:03:22.176 --> 00:03:22.759
Come on.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.639
Now

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:45.319
you're poisoned by Shi Nan

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.000
and persecuted by Gao Ji.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.000
The road ahead

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.639
will only become more dangerous.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.960
Compared

00:03:54.784 --> 00:03:55.960
to what my parents,

00:03:56.864 --> 00:03:57.639
my brother,

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.800
and the people of Pingxiang endured,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.680
the pain I have suffered

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.288
is nothing.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.599
I will tear off the hypocritical masks

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:10.439
of Gao Ji and Shi Nan.

00:04:11.872 --> 00:04:12.719
But I can't just

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:13.879
watch as your poison...

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.520
He's deceived me for years.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.120
I'll never give in to him again.

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:22.160
Consider carefully.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.079
Do you truly want

00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:27.279
to work for the deceiver Shi Nan?

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:31.040
Now Shi Nan also targets Gao Ji.

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:33.639
We can use his power

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:35.240
to settle our scores.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.079
Originally,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.680
Gao Ji wanted to use Gao Zhiying

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:45.680
to have an heir for me,

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:48.199
and legitimize his power grab.

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:50.959
Now without Gao Zhiying,

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:55.120
it's our chance to counterattack.

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:57.279
In the imperial court,

00:04:58.319 --> 00:04:59.680
there are still loyal officials.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.480
With Gao Ji's conduct,

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:05.040
many must have harbored discontent.

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:07.680
They just dare not speak out.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.839
You mean...

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.279
Now,

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.399
my Gu poison is cured.

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:15.839
It's time to show the officials

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.360
who truly rules this empire.

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:25.720
Today,

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:27.519
attend court with me.

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:59.000
Have you heard?

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:01.720
Her Grace left a divorce letter

00:06:01.984 --> 00:06:03.240
and left.

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:06.120
Her Grace should exemplify virtue.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.199
Such behavior

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.160
is childish.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.120
She disregards national dignity.

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:11.199
Enough.

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:19.399
I'm wondering
who's spreading rumors here.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.879
Turns out it is General Yan.

00:06:21.952 --> 00:06:24.096
General Meng,
you bring a sword to court.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.759
Isn't that inappropriate?

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:28.319
Do you know this Bloodthirsty Sword

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.584
was captured from bandits at Biancheng?

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.839
It claimed countless lives,

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.944
sealing throats with one cut.

00:06:36.832 --> 00:06:39.319
Had I not risked rescuing you,

00:06:39.328 --> 00:06:42.120
would you be here waving swords?

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:42.800
You...

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:45.399
I'll show you my power!

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.639
As expected of General Meng,

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:49.639
great skills!

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:52.439
- Impressive!
- Impressive skills and strength!

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:56.279
What nonsense.

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:56.920
Indeed.

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:01.720
Where are the loyal officials?

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:04.040
All are the Prince Regent's lackeys.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.240
Be patient.

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:10.720
We'll see the result soon.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.448
The Prince Regent has arrived.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.519
The Prince Regent is here. Hurry!

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.784
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.720
Let's begin.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.639
What matters do my esteemed officials
have to report?

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.519
Your Majesty,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.040
the southwestern frontier's conflict
has been quelled.

00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:45.439
The Prince Regent sent General Meng
to lead the troops.

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:48.120
He fought for three days and nights
without rest.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.879
Both the Prince Regent and General Meng
have rendered great service.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.800
Assisting Your Majesty
in governing the realm

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.448
is my sacred duty.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.920
General Meng merits praise
for his command. He deserves rewards.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.839
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:07.968
However,

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.759
I have heard

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:12.079
General Meng was besieged by bandits.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.519
In that critical moment,

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.040
General Yan led reinforcements,

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.199
so you broke the siege.

00:08:17.472 --> 00:08:20.560
General Yan also contributed.
He deserves rewards too.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.560
Your Majesty,

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.000
this was merely my duty.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.040
I seek no rewards.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.759
General Yan's toils merit high praise.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.439
Yet he declines rewards.

00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:30.040
It's truly commendable.

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:31.519
In my view,

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.480
the disaster relief funds allocation

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.639
should also be entrusted to General Yan.

00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:38.320
My esteemed officials,

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:39.519
what do you think?

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.960
- Your Majesty is wise.
- Your Majesty is wise.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.480
Your Majesty,

00:08:45.399 --> 00:08:47.000
regarding the disaster relief funds,

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:50.039
another official has already
handled this.

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:50.799
Lord Father,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.039
didn't you instruct me

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.040
to reward and punish justly?

00:08:58.919 --> 00:09:01.600
Reward them. They deserve it.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.480
By the way,

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.528
Lord Father,

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.039
does the sword I bestowed upon you

00:09:09.399 --> 00:09:10.759
serve well?

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.600
Your Majesty's gifted sword

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
cuts iron like clay
and shatters all defenses.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.480
By Your Majesty's grace,

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:22.039
I became the first one in our dynasty

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.399
to bear a sword in court.

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:25.840
As long as it serves.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.879
However,

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.240
in the court,

00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:33.000
why does another sword appear?

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.879
General Meng,

00:09:36.559 --> 00:09:37.720
I don't remember it clearly.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.159
Did I bestow

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.320
this sword upon you?

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:45.360
Well...

00:09:49.159 --> 00:09:49.879
General Meng,

00:09:50.679 --> 00:09:53.200
since this sword wasn't bestowed by me,

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.159
and now you bear a sword in court,

00:09:59.639 --> 00:10:01.039
what punishment do you deserve?

00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:08.159
By our dynastic law,

00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:09.360
bearing swords in court

00:10:09.559 --> 00:10:11.279
is deemed regicide.

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:12.679
You villain,

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:13.799
kicking me when I'm down.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.960
Who's the villain? Who's malicious?

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.679
Loyal officials know it best.

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:20.039
Shi Yu,

00:10:20.679 --> 00:10:21.799
don't test my patience!

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.840
You sit in that position

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.360
solely by the Prince Regent's favor.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.679
So by your logic,

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:31.120
does the empire

00:10:32.559 --> 00:10:33.399
bear the Gao name?

00:10:44.799 --> 00:10:46.399
- Calm down, Your Majesty.
- Calm down, Your Majesty.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.639
Your Majesty,

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.159
I failed to discipline my subordinate.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.759
I shall return

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.240
this sword to you.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.519
Lord Father,

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.799
why must you do this?

00:11:10.759 --> 00:11:12.399
If you don't like

00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:13.856
the sword I gifted you, then...

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.240
General Yan,

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.080
you shall receive it.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:21.879
Thanks, Your Majesty.

00:11:29.639 --> 00:11:30.440
Remember this.

00:11:30.879 --> 00:11:31.600
This sword

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:34.240
strikes down corrupt officials

00:11:34.919 --> 00:11:36.840
and crushes despotic gentry as well.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.440
No prior approval is needed.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.039
I am deeply grateful.

00:11:41.039 --> 00:11:42.440
I'll wield it wisely.

00:11:44.639 --> 00:11:46.200
As for the disaster relief funds,

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.120
I've entrusted them to you.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.960
Do not disappoint me.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.399
I shall fulfill your trust without fail,

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:54.039
even at the cost of my life.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.320
If there's nothing else to report,

00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.456
then

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.240
the court is dismissed.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.279
- Farewell, Your Majesty.
- Farewell, Your Majesty.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.519
Let's go.
